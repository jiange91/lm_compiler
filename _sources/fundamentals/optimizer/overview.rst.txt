Overview
========

The optimizer is the core of Cognify's ability to improve generative AI workflows. It automates the selection of optimal configurations to balance quality and cost, achieving Pareto-efficient solutions that meet user-defined constraints.

Problem Formalization
---------------------

The optimization problem in Cognify is a multi-objective optimization aimed at balancing the trade-offs between **generation quality** and **execution cost** by tuning the value of each Cog in the search space. The problem can be summarized as:

**Given**:
   - A gen-AI workflow (or a set of modules to be optimized)
   - Evaluation criteria (any quality metrics)
   - A searh space (cogs and their options)

**Goal**:
   - Maximize workflow quality
   - Minimize execution cost
  
**Output**:
   A set of configurations along the quality-cost Pareto frontier, each represents a valid trade-off that's not dominoated by any other configuration.
