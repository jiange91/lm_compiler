Furthermore, Chris Bosh missed the entire season and had thought about potentially retiring altogether due to his continuous blood clots. The team got off to an 11\u201330 start. However the Heat rallied to an 30\u201311 finish, only to be eliminated all the same on their last game of the season. They entered game 82 needing a loss from either the Pacers or the Bulls and a victory over the Wizards. However, despite a 110\u2013102 win over the Washington Wizards, both the Pacers and the Bulls won their games. The Heat finished tied with the Chicago Bulls with identical 41\u201341 records but the Bulls won the head-to-head tie breaker against the Heat 2\u20131. As a result, the Heat missed the playoffs for the second time in three years. Hassan Whiteside earned praise for being the NBA's leading rebounder after ending his previous season as the leading shot blocker of the NBA.\n[2]: Derrick Walton | Derrick Walton Jr. (born April 3, 1995) is an American basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA), on a two-way contract with the Heat's NBA G League affiliate, the Sioux Falls Skyforce.

Furthermore, Chris Bosh missed the entire season and had thought about potentially retiring altogether due to his continuous blood clots. The team got off to an 11\u201330 start. However the Heat rallied to an 30\u201311 finish, only to be eliminated all the same on their last game of the season. They entered game 82 needing a loss from either the Pacers or the Bulls and a victory over the Wizards. However, despite a 110\u2013102 win over the Washington Wizards, both the Pacers and the Bulls won their games. The Heat finished tied with the Chicago Bulls with identical 41\u201341 records but the Bulls won the head-to-head tie breaker against the Heat 2\u20131. As a result, the Heat missed the playoffs for the second time in three years. Hassan Whiteside earned praise for being the NBA's leading rebounder after ending his previous season as the leading shot blocker of the NBA.\n[2]: Derrick Walton | Derrick Walton Jr. (born April 3, 1995) is an American basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA), on a two-way contract with the Heat's NBA G League affiliate, the Sioux Falls Skyforce.

Furthermore, Chris Bosh missed the entire season and had thought about potentially retiring altogether due to his continuous blood clots. The team got off to an 11\u201330 start. However the Heat rallied to an 30\u201311 finish, only to be eliminated all the same on their last game of the season. They entered game 82 needing a loss from either the Pacers or the Bulls and a victory over the Wizards. However, despite a 110\u2013102 win over the Washington Wizards, both the Pacers and the Bulls won their games. The Heat finished tied with the Chicago Bulls with identical 41\u201341 records but the Bulls won the head-to-head tie breaker against the Heat 2\u20131. As a result, the Heat missed the playoffs for the second time in three years. Hassan Whiteside earned praise for being the NBA's leading rebounder after ending his previous season as the leading shot blocker of the NBA.\n[2]: Derrick Walton | Derrick Walton Jr. (born April 3, 1995) is an American basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA), on a two-way contract with the Heat's NBA G League affiliate, the Sioux Falls Skyforce.

After a tumultuous negotiation process, Dwyane Wade decided to leave the Heat and sign with the Chicago Bulls in the offseason. This was the first season without Wade since the 2003. Furthermore, Chris Bosh missed the entire season and had thought about potentially retiring altogether due to his continuous blood clots. The team got off to an 11\u201330 start. However the Heat rallied to an 30\u201311 finish, only to be eliminated all the same on their last game of the season. They entered game 82 needing a loss from either the Pacers or the Bulls and a victory over the Wizards. However, despite a 110\u2013102 win over the Washington Wizards, both the Pacers and the Bulls won their games. The Heat finished tied with the Chicago Bulls with identical 41\u201341 records but the Bulls won the head-to-head tie breaker against the Heat 2\u20131. As a result, the Heat missed the playoffs for the second time in three years. Hassan Whiteside earned praise for being the NBA\\'s leading rebounder after ending his previous season as the leading shot blocker of the NBA.\\n[2]: Derrick Walton | Derrick Walton Jr. (born April 3, 1995) is an American basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA), on a two-way contract with the Heat\\'s NBA G League affiliate, the Sioux Falls Skyforce.

Furthermore, Chris Bosh missed the entire season and had thought about potentially retiring altogether due to his continuous blood clots. The team got off to an 11\u201330 start. However the Heat rallied to an 30\u201311 finish, only to be eliminated all the same on their last game of the season. They entered game 82 needing a loss from either the Pacers or the Bulls and a victory over the Wizards. However, despite a 110\u2013102 win over the Washington Wizards, both the Pacers and the Bulls won their games. The Heat finished tied with the Chicago Bulls with identical 41\u201341 records but the Bulls won the head-to-head tie breaker against the Heat 2\u20131. As a result, the Heat missed the playoffs for the second time in three years. Hassan Whiteside earned praise for being the NBA's leading rebounder after ending his previous season as the leading shot blocker of the NBA.\n[2]: Derrick Walton | Derrick Walton Jr. (born April 3, 1995) is an American basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA), on a two-way contract with the Heat's NBA G League affiliate, the Sioux Falls Skyforce.

Furthermore, Chris Bosh missed the entire season and had thought about potentially retiring altogether due to his continuous blood clots. The team got off to an 11\u201330 start. However the Heat rallied to an 30\u201311 finish, only to be eliminated all the same on their last game of the season. They entered game 82 needing a loss from either the Pacers or the Bulls and a victory over the Wizards. However, despite a 110\u2013102 win over the Washington Wizards, both the Pacers and the Bulls won their games. The Heat finished tied with the Chicago Bulls with identical 41\u201341 records but the Bulls won the head-to-head tie breaker against the Heat 2\u20131. As a result, the Heat missed the playoffs for the second time in three years.

Furthermore, Chris Bosh missed the entire season and had thought about potentially retiring altogether due to his continuous blood clots. The team got off to an 11\u201330 start. However the Heat rallied to an 30\u201311 finish, only to be eliminated all the same on their last game of the season. They entered game 82 needing a loss from either the Pacers or the Bulls and a victory over the Wizards. However, despite a 110\u2013102 win over the Washington Wizards, both the Pacers and the Bulls won their games. The Heat finished tied with the Chicago Bulls with identical 41\u201341 records but the Bulls won the head-to-head tie breaker against the Heat 2\u20131. As a result, the Heat missed the playoffs for the second time in three years. Hassan Whiteside earned praise for being the NBA's leading rebounder after ending his previous season as the leading shot blocker of the NBA.\n[2]: Derrick Walton | Derrick Walton Jr. (born April 3, 1995) is an American basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA), on a two-way contract with the Heat's NBA G League affiliate, the Sioux Falls Skyforce.

Furthermore, Chris Bosh missed the entire season and had thought about potentially retiring altogether due to his continuous blood clots. The team got off to an 11\u201330 start. However the Heat rallied to an 30\u201311 finish, only to be eliminated all the same on their last game of the season. They entered game 82 needing a loss from either the Pacers or the Bulls and a victory over the Wizards. However, despite a 110\u2013102 win over the Washington Wizards, both the Pacers and the Bulls won their games. The Heat finished tied with the Chicago Bulls with identical 41\u201341 records but the Bulls won the head-to-head tie breaker against the Heat 2\u20131. As a result, the Heat missed the playoffs for the second time in three years. Hassan Whiteside earned praise for being the NBA's leading rebounder after ending his previous season as the leading shot blocker of the NBA.\n[2]: Derrick Walton | Derrick Walton Jr. (born April 3, 1995) is an American basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA), on a two-way contract with the Heat's NBA G League affiliate, the Sioux Falls Skyforce.
