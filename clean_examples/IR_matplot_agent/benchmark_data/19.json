Use the following sales data: sales_data = [\n    [120, 95, 130, 85, 100],  # Apples\n    [90, 115, 80, 105, 95],   # Oranges\n    [75, 80, 85, 70, 90],     # Bananas\n    [65, 70, 60, 75, 80],     # Grapes\n    [55, 60, 65, 50, 55]      # Berries\n]\nThe y-axis should indicate sales in hundreds, and the x-axis should remain unlabeled.\nTitle the chart 'Sales by Region' and choose soft shades for the bar colors.\nDisplay the cumulative sales value for each region at the top of its stacked bar.\nAdd a table below the chart that corresponds to the data in the bars, with rows colored to match the bar segments. Format the sales numbers in the table to two decimal place, representing the actual value divided by 100.\nThe layout should be adjusted so that both the chart and the table are clearly visible.\nShow the completed chart with the table included.",
    "expert_instruction": "Create a Python program that utilizes two libraries, one for data manipulation and the other for data visualization, to generate a stacked bar chart. The data for the chart should be a two-dimensional list where each sublist signifies a different type of fruit and contains the sales for different regions. The fruit types are 'Apples', 'Oranges', 'Bananas', 'Grapes', and 'Berries'. The regions are 'North', 'South', 'East', 'West', and 'Central', represented as strings. Use the following sales data: sales_data = [\n    [120, 95, 130, 85, 100],  # Apples\n    [90, 115, 80, 105, 95],   # Oranges\n    [75, 80, 85, 70, 90],     # Bananas\n    [65, 70, 60, 75, 80],     # Grapes\n    [55, 60, 65, 50, 55]      # Berries\n]\n\nThe y-axis should represent the sales in hundreds and the x-axis should not have any ticks. The chart should be titled 'Sales by Region'. \n\nUse soft shades for the colors of the bars and make sure that the last value is displayed at the top. \n\nBelow the chart, include a table that shows the same data. The table should have the same row and column labels as the chart, and the cell text should be the sales values divided by 100, formatted to two decimal places. The row colors should match the corresponding bars in the chart. \n\nFinally, adjust the layout to make room for the table and display the chart.",
