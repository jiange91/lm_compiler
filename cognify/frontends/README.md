# Frontends

We currently support [Langchain](./langchain/README.md) and [DSPy](./dspy/README.md). This means if you use either of those frameworks to define your gen-AI workflow, it can be easily translated into our interface (`cognify.Model`) with no changes to your code. For any framework, we preserve the original program semantics as much as possible. When the optimizer is initialized, we automatically detect all globally instantiated chains/modules and convert them to `cognify.Model`s. For each framework, there are nuances to this translation processs. If you want manual control over your optimization targets, you can modify your source code directly. This will turn off the translation.
