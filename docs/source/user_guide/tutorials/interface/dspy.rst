DSPy
====

Cognify supports unmodified DSPy programs. All you need to do is to **register the entry function** for Cognify to execute the workflow during optimization. The following is the DSPy code for the **Math Problem Solver** example:

.. include:: _dspy_front.rst

In DSPy, the :code:`dspy.Predict` class is the primary abstraction for obtaining a response from a language model. When intializing the optimizer, Cognify will automatically translate each predictor in your globally instantiated :code:`dspy.Module` (as defined by the module's :code:`__init__` function) into a :code:`cognify.StructuredModel`. 

.. tip::

  DSPy also contains other, more detailed modules that don't follow the behavior of :code:`dspy.Predict` (e.g., :code:`dspy.ChainOfThought`). In Cognify, we view Chain-of-Thought prompting (and other similar techniques) as possible optimizations to apply to an LLM call on the fly instead of as pre-defined templates. Hence, during the translation process we will strip the "reasoning" step out of the predictor definition and leave it to the optimizer. 
  
By default, Cognify will translate **all** predictors into valid optimization targets. For more fine-grained control over which predictors should be targeted for optimization, you can manually wrap your predictor with our :code:`cognify.PredictModel` class like so: 

.. code-block:: python

  import cognify
  import dspy

  class MathSolverWorkflow(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
      super().__init__()
      self.interpreter_agent = dspy.Predict("problem -> math_model")

      # -- manually wrap the predictor with PredictModel --
      self.solver_agent = cognify.PredictModel(
        "solver_agent",
        dspy.Predict("problem, math_model -> answer")
      )
  
    def forward(self, problem):
      math_model = self.interpreter_agent(problem=problem).math_model
      answer = self.solver_agent(problem=problem, math_model=math_model).answer  # unchanged
      return answer

  ...

If you prefer to define your modules using our :code:`cognify.Model` interface but still want to utilize them with your existing DSPy infrastructure, you can wrap your :code:`cognify.Model` with an :code:`as_predict()` call. This will convert your :code:`cognify.Model` into a :code:`cognify.PredictModel` and follows the :code:`dspy.Predict` protocol.

.. code-block:: python

  import cognify
  import dspy 
  
  cognify_solver_agent = cognify.Model("solver_agent", ...)

  class MathSolverWorkflow(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
      super().__init__()
      self.interpreter_agent = dspy.Predict("problem -> math_model")
      self.solver_agent = cognify.as_predict(solver_agent)  # wrap cognify model here
  
    def forward(self, problem):
      math_model = self.interpreter_agent(problem=problem).math_model
      answer = self.solver_agent(problem=problem, math_model=math_model).answer  # unchanged
      return answer

  ...

Finally to register the workflow to Cognify, you can annotate the entry point as follows:

.. code-block:: python

  import cognify
  ...

  math_agent = MathSolverWorkflow()

  @cognify.register_workflow
  def math_solver_workflow(problem):
    answer = my_workflow(problem=problem)
    return {"answer": answer}
