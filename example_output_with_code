To align the new multi-agent system with the functionality of the old single-agent system, we need to ensure that the final output of the new system matches the output schema of the old system. The old system outputs a single decision variable, which can be one of "ae", "re", "ge", or "accept".

Here's the plan:

1. **Ensure Output Consistency**: Each agent in the new system should output a variable that can be used to determine the final decision.
2. **Define JSON Schemas**: Create JSON schemas for each agent's output.
3. **Combine Outputs**: Write a function to combine the outputs of the agents to produce the final decision.

### Step 1: Ensure Output Consistency
The new system already has agents that output variables relevant to the final decision. We need to ensure that these outputs are correctly named and used.

### Step 2: Define JSON Schemas
We will define the JSON schemas for each agent's output.

#### Question Evaluation Agent
```json
{
    "title": "QuestionEvaluationSchema",
    "description": "Evaluation of whether the answer addresses the question.",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "question_evaluation": {
            "title": "Question Evaluation",
            "description": "Grade the answer as 'ae' if it does not address the question.",
            "enum": ["ae", "pass"],
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "required": ["question_evaluation"]
}
```

#### Knowledge Relevance Agent
```json
{
    "title": "KnowledgeRelevanceSchema",
    "description": "Evaluation of the relevance of the knowledge to the question.",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "knowledge_relevance": {
            "title": "Knowledge Relevance",
            "description": "Grade the knowledge as 're' if it is irrelevant to the question.",
            "enum": ["re", "pass"],
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "required": ["knowledge_relevance"]
}
```

#### Grounding Evaluation Agent
```json
{
    "title": "GroundingEvaluationSchema",
    "description": "Evaluation of whether the answer is grounded in the knowledge.",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "decision": {
            "title": "Decision",
            "description": "Grade the answer as 'ge' if it is not grounded in the knowledge, otherwise 'accept'.",
            "enum": ["ge", "accept"],
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "required": ["decision"]
}
```

### Step 3: Combine Outputs
We need to write a function to combine the outputs of the agents to produce the final decision.

```python
def combine_outputs(output_schema, question_evaluation=None, knowledge_relevance=None, decision=None):
    if question_evaluation == 'ae':
        return output_schema(decision='ae')
    elif knowledge_relevance == 're':
        return output_schema(decision='re')
    elif decision in ['ge', 'accept']:
        return output_schema(decision=decision)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid decision path")
```

### Final Output
The final output will be compatible with the original output schema "VerifyDecision".

### Summary
- **Question Evaluation Agent**: Evaluates if the answer addresses the question.
- **Knowledge Relevance Agent**: Evaluates the relevance of the knowledge to the question.
- **Grounding Evaluation Agent**: Evaluates if the answer is grounded in the knowledge.

By following this plan, we ensure that the new multi-agent system produces an output that is consistent with the original single-agent system.
