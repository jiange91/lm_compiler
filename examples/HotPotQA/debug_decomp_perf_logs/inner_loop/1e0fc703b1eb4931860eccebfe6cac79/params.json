Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which building is taller between the Empire State Building and the Bank of America Tower.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Question\nThe question asks us to identify which building is taller: the Empire State Building or the Bank of America Tower.\n\n### Step 2: Review Key Points\nWe have the following key points to consider:\n- **Bank of America Tower**:\n  - It is the fifth tallest building in New York City.\n  - It has a large energy usage and a comparatively small occupancy rate compared to the Empire State Building.\n\n- **Empire State Building**:\n  - It is historically recognized as one of the tallest buildings in the world.\n  - It regained the title of the tallest building in New York City after the September 11 attacks in 2001.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Information\nFrom the key points:\n- The Bank of America Tower is ranked as the fifth tallest building in New York City, which means there are four buildings taller than it, including the Empire State Building.\n- The Empire State Building is known for its historical significance and has been recognized as one of the tallest buildings in the world.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Heights\n- Since the Bank of America Tower is the fifth tallest, it is inherently shorter than the Empire State Building, which is one of the tallest buildings in New York City.\n\n### Step 5: Formulate the Conclusion\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that the Empire State Building is taller than the Bank of America Tower.\n\n### Final Response\nTherefore, the answer to the question \"Which is taller, the Empire State Building or the Bank of America Tower?\" is:\n\n**Empire State Building**. \n\nThis conclusion is supported by the fact that the Bank of America Tower ranks fifth in height among New York City buildings, while the Empire State Building is one of the tallest."
