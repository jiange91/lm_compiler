Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Type of Whiskey**: The document specifies that \"1792 Bourbon\" is a type of Kentucky straight Bourbon whiskey. Therefore, we are interested in the revenue generated from bourbon whiskey in the United States.\n\n2. **Gathering Relevant Information**: From the context provided, we see that:\n   - In 2014, the wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. was about $2.7 billion.\n   - Bourbon made up a significant portion of the U.S. exports of distilled spirits, with exports surpassing $1 billion for the first time in 2013.\n\n3. **Summary of Findings**: The key piece of data we have is that approximately $2.7 billion is spent on bourbon whiskey in the U.S. This figure reflects wholesale market revenue and indicates the financial scale of bourbon sales.\n\nNow, we can formulate the final answer based on this reasoning. \n\n**Final Answer**: Approximately $2.7 billion is spent on bourbon whiskey in the United States.\n\nAnswer: $2.7 billion\n        \n---\n\n** Worker Proposal 1 **\n\nRationale: \n: Let's solve this problem step by step before giving the final response\n\n\n: Sure! Let's break down the information step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Type of Whiskey**: The 1792 Bourbon is a type of bourbon whiskey. \n\n2. **Contextual Information**: We need to find data related to the spending or revenue for bourbon whiskey in the U.S. from the provided context. \n\n3. **Relevant Data Points**:\n   - In context [2], it mentions that more than 19 million nine-liter cases of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey were sold in the U.S., generating almost $2.7 billion in wholesale distillery revenue.\n   - Additionally, context [3] corroborates that the distillers' wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. was about $2.7 billion.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Based on the context, we can determine that the amount spent on bourbon whiskey in the United States is approximately $2.7 billion.\n\nNow, I can formulate the final response.

Let's break down the information we have:\n\n1. **Understanding 1792 Bourbon**: The context tells us that 1792 Bourbon is a Kentucky straight Bourbon whiskey produced by the Barton 1792 Distillery. This indicates that it falls under the category of bourbon whiskey.\n\n2. **Market Revenue**: From the provided context, particularly in the second and third entries, we find that in 2014, distillers' wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. was about $2.7 billion. This figure is crucial as it represents the overall spending on bourbon whiskey in the United States.\n\n3. **Bourbon Exports**: The context mentions that bourbon exports surpassed $1 billion in 2014, but this is separate from the domestic revenue, which we are focusing on.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the question specifically asks about the spending on the type of whiskey that 1792 Whiskey is (which is bourbon), we can directly use the revenue figure mentioned.\n\nNow, putting all this together, we can formulate the final response. \n\nShall I proceed with the final answer?\n\nAnswer: $2.7 billion\n        "

Would you like me to do that?\n\nAnswer: Approximately $2.7 billion.\n        \n---\n\n** Worker Proposal 2 **\n\nRationale: \n: Let's solve this problem step by step before giving the final response\n\n\n: Sure! Let's break down the information we have:\n\n1. **Understanding 1792 Bourbon**: The context tells us that 1792 Bourbon is a Kentucky straight Bourbon whiskey produced by the Barton 1792 Distillery. This indicates that it falls under the category of bourbon whiskey.\n\n2. **Market Revenue**: From the provided context, particularly in the second and third entries, we find that in 2014, distillers' wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. was about $2.7 billion. This figure is crucial as it represents the overall spending on bourbon whiskey in the United States.\n\n3. **Bourbon Exports**: The context mentions that bourbon exports surpassed $1 billion in 2014, but this is separate from the domestic revenue, which we are focusing on.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the question specifically asks about the spending on the type of whiskey that 1792 Whiskey is (which is bourbon), we can directly use the revenue figure mentioned.\n\nNow, putting all this together, we can formulate the final response. \n\nShall I proceed with the final answer?\n\nAnswer: $2.7 billion\n        "

Let's break this down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the Type of Whiskey**: The document specifies that \"1792 Bourbon\" is a type of Kentucky straight Bourbon whiskey. Therefore, we are interested in the revenue generated from bourbon whiskey in the United States.\n\n2. **Gathering Relevant Information**: From the context provided, we see that:\n   - In 2014, the wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. was about $2.7 billion.\n   - Bourbon made up a significant portion of the U.S. exports of distilled spirits, with exports surpassing $1 billion for the first time in 2013.\n\n3. **Summary of Findings**: The key piece of data we have is that approximately $2.7 billion is spent on bourbon whiskey in the U.S. This figure reflects wholesale market revenue and indicates the financial scale of bourbon sales.\n\nNow, we can formulate the final answer based on this reasoning. \n\n**Final Answer**: Approximately $2.7 billion is spent on bourbon whiskey in the United States."

Let's break down the information we have:\n\n1. **Understanding 1792 Bourbon**: The context tells us that 1792 Bourbon is a Kentucky straight Bourbon whiskey produced by the Barton 1792 Distillery. This indicates that it falls under the category of bourbon whiskey.\n\n2. **Market Revenue**: From the provided context, particularly in the second and third entries, we find that in 2014, distillers' wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. was about $2.7 billion. This figure is crucial as it represents the overall spending on bourbon whiskey in the United States.\n\n3. **Bourbon Exports**: The context mentions that bourbon exports surpassed $1 billion in 2014, but this is separate from the domestic revenue, which we are focusing on.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since the question specifically asks about the spending on the type of whiskey that 1792 Whiskey is (which is bourbon), we can directly use the revenue figure mentioned.\n\nNow, putting all this together, we can formulate the final response. \n\nShall I proceed with the final answer?"
