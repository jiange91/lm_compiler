Since the player was part of the 2013 NBA All-Defensive Team, we'll include that as well.\n   - For the \"tied voting\" part, we need to understand how to phrase a search query that captures the idea of a tie during the voting for the 2013 NBA All-Defensive Team.\n\n4. **Phrasing the search query**:\n   - To capture the player who was the ninth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft and tied for the 2013 NBA All-Defensive Team, we can use the following query:\n     `ninth overall pick 2007 NBA draft AND 2013 NBA All-Defensive Team tied`\n\n5. **Potential refinement**:\n   - Since we're looking for a player who was part of both the 2007 NBA draft and the 2013 NBA All-Defensive Team, we might need to refine the search query to include the player's name or nickname to narrow down the results.\n\n6. **Current search query**:\n   Search_query: `ninth overall pick 2007 NBA draft AND 2013 NBA All-Defensive Team tied`"

It mentions how wormholes are a method of moving through space according to the general theory of relativity.\n\n2. **Identifying key figures**: The context specifically mentions Nathan Rosen, who, along with Albert Einstein, is credited for the theoretical formulation of the concept of wormholes. They both collaborated on the idea of what is fundamentally known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge.\n\n3. **Analyzing the question**: The question asks for a person that is common between \"Wormholes in fiction\" and Nathan Rosen. Since the context highlights both Nathan Rosen and Albert Einstein in relation to the concept of wormholes, we need to determine if there are any other individuals mentioned that might fit.\n\n4. **Conclusion from the analysis**: The only two names consistently mentioned in relation to wormholes are Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen.

Let's break down the question and the provided context step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The context discusses wormholes, particularly the concept of an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is a theoretical construct in the general theory of relativity. It mentions both Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen as key figures associated with this concept.\n\n2. **Identifying Key Figures**: The context explicitly names Nathan Rosen and associates him with Albert Einstein in the formulation of the Einstein-Rosen bridge. This indicates a collaborative relationship between the two in the development of the theory regarding wormholes.\n\n3. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks for a person that is common between \"Wormholes in fiction\" and Nathan Rosen. Given that the context highlights both Nathan Rosen and Albert Einstein in relation to wormholes, we need to determine if there are any other individuals mentioned that might fit.\n\n4. **Conclusion from the Analysis**: The only two names consistently mentioned in relation to wormholes are Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen. Therefore, they are the individuals who have a direct connection to the concept of wormholes as discussed in the context.\n\nNow that we have analyzed the information, we can formulate a final answer based on the consensus reached through this reasoning process. Would you like to proceed with that?"

Wormholes are a popular feature of science fiction as they allow faster-than-light (FTL) interstellar travel within human timescales. A related concept in various fictional genres is the Portable hole. While there\\'s no clear demarcation between the two, this article deals with fictional, but pseudo-scientific, treatments of faster-than-light travel through space. Wormholes are also the principal means of space travel in the \"\"Stargate\"\" movie and the spin-off television series,\"', '\"Wormholes in fiction\" | \"Vortex was created by the Time Lords (an ancient and powerful race of human-looking aliens that can control space and time and the protagonist is one of them) to allow travel of TARDISes (Time And Relative Dimension In Space) to any point in spacetime. In some earlier analyses of general relativity, the event horizon of a black hole was believed to form an Einstein-Rosen bridge. Works envisioning black holes as wormholes are listed in Black Holes as Wormhole Bridges.

It mentions how wormholes are a method of moving through space according to the general theory of relativity.\n\n2. **Identifying key figures**: The context specifically mentions Nathan Rosen, who, along with Albert Einstein, is credited for the theoretical formulation of the concept of wormholes. They both collaborated on the idea of what is fundamentally known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge.\n\n3. **Analyzing the question**: The question asks for a person that is common between \"Wormholes in fiction\" and Nathan Rosen. Since the context highlights both Nathan Rosen and Albert Einstein in relation to the concept of wormholes, we need to determine if there are any other individuals mentioned that might fit.\n\n4. **Conclusion from the analysis**: The only two names consistently mentioned in relation to wormholes are Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen.

Since the player was part of the 2013 NBA All-Defensive Team, we'll include that as well.\n   - For the \"tied voting\" part, we need to understand how to phrase a search query that captures the idea of a tie during the voting for the 2013 NBA All-Defensive Team.\n\n4. **Phrasing the search query**:\n   - To capture the player who was the ninth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft and tied for the 2013 NBA All-Defensive Team, we can use the following query:\n     `ninth overall pick 2007 NBA draft AND 2013 NBA All-Defensive Team tied`\n\n5. **Potential refinement**:\n   - Since we're looking for a player who was part of both the 2007 NBA draft and the 2013 NBA All-Defensive Team, we might need to refine the search query to include the player's name or nickname to narrow down the results.\n\n6. **Current search query**:\n   Search_query: `ninth overall pick 2007 NBA draft AND 2013 NBA All-Defensive Team tied`"
