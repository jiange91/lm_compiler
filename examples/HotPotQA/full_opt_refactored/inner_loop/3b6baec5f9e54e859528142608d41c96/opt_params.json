Avildsen are both film producers, we need to analyze the information provided in the context about each individual.\n\n1. **Baltasar Korm\u00e1kur**:\n   - The context states that he is an \"Icelandic actor, theater and film director, and film producer.\" This indicates that he has indeed worked as a film producer.\n\n2. **John G. Avildsen**:\n   - The context does not provide any information about John G. Avildsen. Therefore, we cannot confirm whether he is a film producer based on the provided context.\n\nSince the context only confirms that Baltasar Korm\u00e1kur is a film producer and does not provide any information about John G. Avildsen, we cannot definitively say that both are film producers.\n\nNow, based on this reasoning, I will provide the final response. \n\nAnswer: No, only Baltasar Korm\u00e1kur is confirmed as a film producer based on the context."
