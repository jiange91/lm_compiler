Wilson received the Medal of Honor from President Harry S. Truman during ceremonies at the White House on April 11, 1952.\n\n2. **Establish the Title of Harry S.

This indicates that she is the actress we are focusing on.\n\n2. **Co-founder of Voto Latino**: The context then brings up Voto Latino, which is a nonprofit organization co-founded by Rosario Dawson and Phil Colon. There is no information in the provided context indicating that Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is involved with Voto Latino or is a co-founder.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The question asks for an American actress who made her film debut in \"Kids\" and is also a co-founder of Voto Latino. Based on the information analyzed, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is not a co-founder of Voto Latino; rather, Rosario Dawson is the one associated with that organization.\n\nNow, combining these insights, we can provide the final answer. \n\n**Final Response**: Rosario Dawson.\n\nAnswer: Rosario Dawson.\n        \n---\n\n** Worker Proposal 2 **\n\nRationale: Human: Here is the reasoning steps:\n\nHuman: Let's solve this problem step by step before giving the final response\n\nAI: First, let's identify the key information from the context provided:\n\n1. **Chlo\u00eb Sevigny** is mentioned as an American actress who made her film debut in the 1995 drama \"Kids.\"\n2. The context does not mention any connection between Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Voto Latino.\n3. **Voto Latino** was co-founded by **Rosario Dawson** and Phil Colon, as stated in the context.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question:\n\n- The question asks for an American actress who made their film debut in \"Kids\" and is also a co-founder of Voto Latino.\n\nSince the context clearly indicates that Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is connected to \"Kids\" but does not mention her association with Voto Latino, while it specifies that Voto Latino was co-founded by Rosario Dawson, it leads to the conclusion that **Rosario Dawson** is the relevant figure associated with Voto Latino.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is **Rosario Dawson**, as she is the co-founder of Voto Latino, while Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is only connected to the film \"Kids.\" \n\nNow, formulating the final answer: \n\n**Answer: Rosario Dawson**\n\nAnswer: Rosario Dawson\n        "

While there may be overlaps in influences and styles at times, they have different core characteristics and fan bases.\n\nNow that we've analyzed the context, we can formulate the final response based on our findings."

This indicates that she is the actress we are focusing on.\n\n2. **Co-founder of Voto Latino**: The context then brings up Voto Latino, which is a nonprofit organization co-founded by Rosario Dawson and Phil Colon. There is no information in the provided context indicating that Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is involved with Voto Latino or is a co-founder.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The question asks for an American actress who made her film debut in \"Kids\" and is also a co-founder of Voto Latino. Based on the information analyzed, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is not a co-founder of Voto Latino; rather, Rosario Dawson is the one associated with that organization.\n\nNow, combining these insights, we can provide the final answer. \n\n**Final Response**: Rosario Dawson.\n\nAnswer: Rosario Dawson.\n        \n---\n\n** Worker Proposal 2 **\n\nRationale: Human: Here is the reasoning steps:\n\nHuman: Let's solve this problem step by step before giving the final response\n\nAI: First, let's identify the key information from the context provided:\n\n1. **Chlo\u00eb Sevigny** is mentioned as an American actress who made her film debut in the 1995 drama \"Kids.\"\n2. The context does not mention any connection between Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Voto Latino.\n3. **Voto Latino** was co-founded by **Rosario Dawson** and Phil Colon, as stated in the context.\n\nNow, let's analyze the question:\n\n- The question asks for an American actress who made their film debut in \"Kids\" and is also a co-founder of Voto Latino.\n\nSince the context clearly indicates that Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is connected to \"Kids\" but does not mention her association with Voto Latino, while it specifies that Voto Latino was co-founded by Rosario Dawson, it leads to the conclusion that **Rosario Dawson** is the relevant figure associated with Voto Latino.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is **Rosario Dawson**, as she is the co-founder of Voto Latino, while Chlo\u00eb Sevigny is only connected to the film \"Kids.\" \n\nNow, formulating the final answer: \n\n**Answer: Rosario Dawson**\n\nAnswer: Rosario Dawson\n        "

The context specifies that it was active during that time frame, meaning it was last published in 1979.\n\n2. **Self**: The context does not provide any information about \"Self\", including its publication date or relevance to the question.\n\nSince there is no information about \"Self\" in the context, we cannot determine its publication date. However, we can conclude that \"Who Put the Bomp\" was published until 1979.\n\nNow, since we have established that \"Who Put the Bomp\" last published in 1979 and there is no information indicating that \"Self\" was published after that date, we can infer that \"Who Put the Bomp\" is the only publication with a defined time frame.\n\nThus, based on the available information, we can conclude our analysis. \n\nNow, combining these insights leads us to the final answer."
