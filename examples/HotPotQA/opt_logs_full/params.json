Let's break down the context and the question step by step.\n\n1. **Identify Key Information in the Context:**\n   - The Ontario Raiders were a lacrosse team that was purchased by a group including Bill Watters, Paul Beeston, Tie Domi, and Bobby Orr.\n   - The purchase price for the team was $250,000.\n   - The Ontario Raiders were a member of the National Lacrosse League during the 1998 season and were originally based in Hamilton, Ontario, before being relocated to Toronto.\n\n2. **Analyze the Question:**\n   - The question asks about a \"retired Canadian professional ice hockey player of Albanian origin\" and how much he and his cohorts spent to purchase the Ontario Raiders.\n   - The context does not mention any retired Canadian professional ice hockey player of Albanian origin involved in the purchase of the Ontario Raiders.\n\n3. **Determine Relevant Search Terms:**\n   - Since the context does not provide information about a retired Canadian professional ice hockey player of Albanian origin, we need to focus on the purchase of the Ontario Raiders.\n   - Key terms to include in the search query would be \"Ontario Raiders purchase price,\" \"Bobby Orr,\" \"Bill Watters,\" \"Paul Beeston,\" and \"Tie Domi.\"\n\n4. **Formulate the Search Query:**\n   - The search query should aim to find information about the purchase of the Ontario Raiders, specifically focusing on the price and the individuals involved.\n\n**Final Search Query:**\n\"Ontario Raiders purchase price Bill Watters Paul Beeston Tie Domi Bobby Orr\""
