If Scott Shaw has a background in martial arts, it is likely he may have contributed to this publication.\n\n2. **Southwest Art**: This magazine is dedicated to the art scene in the southwestern United States, covering artists, exhibitions, and art events. If Scott Shaw has written about art or artists, he may have contributed to this magazine.\n\nTo find the answer, you would need to search the archives or websites of both magazines for articles authored by Scott Shaw. \n\nBased on the context, if Scott Shaw is primarily known for his work in martial arts, it is more likely that he has published articles in **Tae Kwon Do Times**. However, if he has a significant connection to the art world, he may also have articles in **Southwest Art**. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer would depend on the specific contributions of Scott Shaw to each magazine, and further research into their archives would provide a definitive answer.",
