Zloof at IBM Research during the mid-1970s, in parallel to the development of SQL. It is the first graphical query language, using visual tables where the user would enter commands, example elements and conditions. Many graphical front-ends for databases use the ideas from QBE today. Originally limited only for the purpose of retrieving data, QBE was later extended to allow other operations, such as inserts, deletes and updates, as well as creation of temporary tables. The motivation behind QBE\"', '\"Query by Example\" | \"is that a parser can convert the user\\'s actions into statements expressed in a database manipulation language, such as SQL. Behind the scenes, it is this statement that is actually executed. A suitably comprehensive front-end can minimize the burden on the user to remember the finer details of SQL, and it is easier and more productive for end-users (and even programmers) to select tables and columns by selecting them rather than typing in their names, In the context of information retrieval, QBE has a somewhat different meaning.

It provides a way for a software user to perform queries without having to know a query language (such as SQL). The software can automatically generate the queries for the user (usually behind the scenes). Here are some examples: Example Form B: Resulting SQL: Note how blank items do not generate SQL\"']",

                "output": "To determine which magazine has published articles by Scott Shaw, we can look for references or archives from both Tae Kwon Do Times and Southwest Art. \n\n1. **Tae Kwon Do Times**: This magazine focuses on martial arts, particularly Tae Kwon Do, and often features articles related to martial arts techniques, training, and culture. If Scott Shaw has a background in martial arts, it is plausible that he may have contributed articles here.\n\n2. **Southwest Art**: This magazine is dedicated to the art scene in the Southwestern United States, covering artists, exhibitions, and art events. If Scott Shaw has a connection to the art world, he may have written for this publication as well.\n\nTo find the answer, you would need to search the archives or websites of both magazines for articles authored by Scott Shaw. \n\nBased on the context, if Scott Shaw is primarily known for his work in martial arts, it is likely that he has published articles in **Tae Kwon Do Times**. However, if he has a significant presence in the art community, he may also have articles in **Southwest Art**. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer would depend on the specific contributions of Scott Shaw to each magazine, and further research into their archives would be necessary to confirm which magazine has published his articles.",
