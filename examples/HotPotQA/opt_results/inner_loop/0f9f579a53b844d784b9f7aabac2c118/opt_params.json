We need to determine which sea this port belongs to.\n\n2. **Geographical Context**: The question asks about the relationship between the sea and an ocean, suggesting that the answer involves geographical classifications.\n\n3. **Possible Connections**: We should consider that the \"sea\" might be connected to the Mediterranean Sea, as The Port of Reggio is located in Italy. The question suggests that there is a broader classification of this sea as being part of an ocean.\n\nBased on this analysis, we need to incorporate the following elements into our search query:\n- The name of the port: \"Port of Reggio\"\n- The geographical classification of the sea\n- The connection to an ocean\n\nNow, I will formulate the search query that encapsulates these key elements. \n\nsearch_query:\n\"Port of Reggio sea classification ocean connection\"\n\nAnswer: \"Port of Reggio sea classification ocean connection\"\n        "
