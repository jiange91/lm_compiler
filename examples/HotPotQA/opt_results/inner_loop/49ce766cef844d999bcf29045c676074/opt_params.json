Two years later, \"\"Oliver and Company\"\" successfully outgrossed \"\"The Land Before Time\"\", launching an era of increased theatrical turnout for the studio. In 1988, Disney collaborated with Steven Spielberg, a long-time animation fan and producer of \"\"An American Tail\"\" and \"\"The Land Before Time\"\", to produce \"\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\"\", a live action/animation hybrid which featured animated characters from the 1930s and 1940s\"\n[3]: \"Walt Disney Animation Studios\" | \"\"\"Time\"\" and went on to become the most successful animated feature to that date.

Let's break down the context provided to find the answer.\n\n1. **Identifying Key Information**: The question asks about the director of a film that was successful along with \"An American Tail\" and \"The Land Before Time,\" leading Steven Spielberg to establish his own animation studio.\n\n2. **Analyzing Context**:\n   - From the context, we see references to \"An American Tail\" and \"The Land Before Time.\" However, the context does not explicitly state which film's success led Spielberg to establish his own studio.\n   - It mentions Don Bluth, who directed \"An American Tail\" and had partnered with Spielberg but parted ways due to creative differences.\n\n3. **Understanding the Question**: The question is not directly answered in the context provided. It focuses on the success of films that influenced Spielberg's decisions regarding animation.\n\n4. **Making Inferences**: Since Spielberg collaborated with various animators and studios, the film that might prompt such an action would likely be significant in the animation realm. The context does not specify which film it is, but it indicates that Spielberg had a strong inclination towards animation.\n\n5. **Looking for External Knowledge**: To answer the question accurately, I can recall that \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\" directed by Robert Zemeckis, was a significant project that combined live-action and animation and was produced during this time.\n\nNow that we have worked through the reasoning, we can formulate the final response based on this analysis. \n\nLet's proceed to the answer now."

This implies that we need to look for information that connects the identified sea to a larger ocean.\n\n3. **Geographical Context**: Since this involves geographical locations, it would be beneficial to include terms related to geography, such as \"ocean\" and \"sea.\"\n\nNow, let's formulate a search query that encapsulates these elements. \n\nThe search query should include:\n- The name of the port (The Port of Reggio)\n- The sea associated with this port\n- The ocean that this sea is sometimes considered a part of\n\nNow, I will construct the search query based on this reasoning. \n\nsearch_query:\n\"The Port of Reggio sea\" AND \"which ocean is this sea part of\""
