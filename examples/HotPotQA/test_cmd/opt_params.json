We need to find out which university he is associated with.\n3. **Focus on the Founding Year**: The ultimate goal is to find out the year the institution was founded.\n\nNow, we can formulate a search query that encompasses these elements:\n\n- Include John Laub's name to find relevant information about him.\n- Specify his role as a Distinguished University Professor in Criminology and Criminal Justice.\n- Look for the name of the institution he is affiliated with.\n- Finally, search for the founding year of that institution.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, the search query can be structured as follows:\n\n**search_query**: \"John Laub American criminologist Distinguished University Professor Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice founding year\""

The question is asking about the spending on a specific type of whiskey, namely 1792 Whiskey, within the United States. \n\n1. **Identify the type of whiskey**: The question specifically mentions \"1792 Whiskey,\" which is a brand of bourbon whiskey. This is important because it narrows down the search to a specific category of whiskey.\n\n2. **Focus on spending**: The question is concerned with the amount of money spent on this type of whiskey. This could involve looking for statistics, market reports, or consumer spending data related to bourbon whiskey in general or 1792 Whiskey specifically.\n\n3. **Geographical context**: The question specifies \"in the United States,\" which means the search should focus on data relevant to the U.S. market.\n\n4. **Possible nuances**: The search might also consider variations in spending, such as retail sales, consumer preferences, or comparisons with other whiskey brands.\n\nBased on this breakdown, the search query should encompass these elements to retrieve relevant information. \n\nNow, let's formulate the search query. \n\n**Search Query**: \n\"1792 Whiskey spending statistics United States market report bourbon whiskey consumer spending 2023\""
