We need to focus on the market and spending related to Bourbon whiskey.\n\n2. **Market Trends**: The context provides information about the growth of bourbon whiskey from 2009 to 2014, including increases in both volume and revenue. This indicates that there is a significant market for bourbons, especially high-end bourbons.\n\n3. **Revenue Data**: We need to find specific spending figures or revenue data related to bourbon whiskey, especially considering the high-end or premium segments, since 1792 Bourbon is positioned as a premium product.\n\n4. **Time Frame**: The context mentions data from 2009 to 2014.

This classification is important as it narrows down the type of whiskey we are interested in.\n\n2. **Determine the Relevant Financial Information**: The question seeks information regarding how much is spent on the type of whiskey that 1792 belongs to in the United States. This would typically involve looking for statistics on sales, revenue, or market share specifically for Bourbon whiskey.\n\n3. **Looking for Trends and Data**: The context provides some information about the growth of whiskey sales in general, particularly highlighting trends from 2009-2014. However, it doesn\u2019t specify the total spending or sales figures for Bourbon specifically.\n\n4. **Search for Specific Figures**: To answer the question, we need a search query that targets statistics related to Bourbon whiskey sales in the U.S., particularly focusing on overall spending or market size.\n\nNow, considering these points, I will formulate a search query that will help retrieve the necessary information. \n\n**Proposed Search Query**: \"Bourbon whiskey sales revenue United States 2023\"\n\nAnswer: \"Bourbon whiskey sales revenue United States 2023\"\n        \n---\n\n** Worker Proposal 2 **\n\nRationale: \n: Let's solve this problem step by step before giving the final response\n\n\n: Sure!
