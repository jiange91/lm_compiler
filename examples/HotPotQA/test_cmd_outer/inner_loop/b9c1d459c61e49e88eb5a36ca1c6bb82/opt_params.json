The total revenue generated from bourbon and Tennessee whiskey sales was noted to be almost $2.7 billion in wholesale distillery revenue.\n\n4. **Determine the Specifics**: While the context provides a general figure for the overall sales and revenue of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey, it does not specify the amount spent on just bourbon whiskey or detail the spending for 1792 Whiskey specifically.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the information available, we can conclude that the overall spending on bourbon whiskey (which includes 1792 Whiskey) amounts to nearly $2.7 billion in wholesale distillery revenue, but we do not have a specific breakdown for 1792 Whiskey alone.\n\nNow, let's formulate the final answer based on this reasoning. \n\nThe total spent on bourbon whiskey in the United States, which includes 1792 Whiskey, is approximately $2.7 billion in wholesale distillery revenue."
