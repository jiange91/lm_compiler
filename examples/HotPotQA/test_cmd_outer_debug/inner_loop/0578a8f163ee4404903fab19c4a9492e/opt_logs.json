The geographical focus is on the United States.\n\nNext, we need to consider synonyms and related terms that might yield relevant results. For example, \"1792 Whiskey\" is a brand, and we might look for broader categories like \"bourbon\" or \"American whiskey\" since 1792 Whiskey falls under these categories.\n\nWe should also think about the context of spending. This could involve looking for statistics on whiskey sales, market analysis reports, or consumer spending data.\n\nNow, let's structure the search query to encompass these elements. \n\nA well-structured search query might look like this:\n\n\"1792 Whiskey sales data United States\" OR \"1792 Bourbon spending statistics USA\" OR \"American whiskey market expenditures 2023\" OR \"whiskey consumer spending United States 2023\" \n\nThis query aims to cover various aspects of the question while being specific enough to retrieve relevant information. \n\nNow, let's finalize the search query based on this reasoning. \n\n**Final Search Query**: \n\"1792 Whiskey sales data United States\" OR \"1792 Bourbon spending statistics USA\" OR \"American whiskey market expenditures 2023\" OR \"whiskey consumer spending United States 2023\""

The question asks about:\n\n1. The amount of money spent on a specific type of whiskey, which is 1792 Whiskey.\n2. The geographical focus is on the United States.\n\nNext, we need to consider synonyms and related terms that might yield relevant results. For example, \"1792 Whiskey\" is a brand, and we might look for broader categories like \"bourbon\" or \"American whiskey\" since 1792 Whiskey falls under these categories.\n\nWe should also think about the context of spending. This could involve looking for statistics on whiskey sales, market analysis reports, or consumer spending data.\n\nNow, let's structure the search query to encompass these elements. \n\nA well-structured search query might look like this:\n\n\"1792 Whiskey sales data United States\" OR \"1792 Bourbon spending statistics USA\" OR \"American whiskey market expenditures 2023\" OR \"whiskey consumer spending United States 2023\" \n\nThis query aims to cover various aspects of the question while being specific enough to retrieve relevant information. \n\nNow, let's finalize the search query based on this reasoning. \n\n**Final Search Query**: \n\"1792 Whiskey sales data United States\" OR \"1792 Bourbon spending statistics USA\" OR \"American whiskey market expenditures 2023\" OR \"whiskey consumer spending United States 2023\"\n\nAnswer: \"1792 Whiskey sales data United States\" OR \"1792 Bourbon spending statistics USA\" OR \"American whiskey market expenditures 2023\" OR \"whiskey consumer spending United States 2023\"\n        \n---\n\n** Worker Proposal 1 **\n\nRationale: \n: Let's solve this problem step by step before giving the final response\n\n\n: To craft an effective search query for the question about the spending on the type of whiskey that 1792 Whiskey represents in the United States, we should break down the key components of the question:\n\n1. **Type of Whiskey**: 1792 Whiskey is a bourbon, so we need to focus on bourbon whiskey in general.\n2. **Spending**: We are looking for data or statistics about how much money is spent on bourbon whiskey in the U.S.\n3. **Geographical Focus**: The query should specify that the information pertains to the United States.\n\nNow, considering these elements, we will want to include terms related to bourbon whiskey sales, expenditures, market value, consumer spending, or industry reports.

The question is about John Laub, who is an American criminologist and a Distinguished University Professor in a specific academic department. We need to find out:\n\n1. The name of the institution where he holds his professorship.\n2. The founding year of that institution.\n\nWe can break down the search into a few components:\n\n- John Laub's full name and professional background (criminologist, Distinguished University Professor).\n- The specific department (Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice).\n- The institution's name where he is a professor.\n- The founding year of that institution.\n\nWith these components in mind, the search query should focus on retrieving information about John Laub's affiliation and then use that to find the founding year of the institution.\n\nNow, let's formulate the search query to capture all these elements effectively. \n\nWe might use phrases like \"John Laub American criminologist,\" \"Distinguished University Professor Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice,\" and \"founding year of [institution name].\"\n\nHere's a detailed search query that could be used: \n\n`\"John Laub\" \"American criminologist\" \"Distinguished University Professor\" \"Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice\" \"founding year\" \"institution name\" `\n\nThis query aims to discover the name of the institution and its founding year by focusing on the relevant keywords associated with John Laub's academic position. \n\nNow, we can finalize the search query based on this reasoning. \n\nFinal search query: \n`\"John Laub\" \"American criminologist\" \"Distinguished University Professor\" \"Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice\" \"founded in\" \"year\" \"institution name\"`"

The question asks about:\n\n1. The amount of money spent on a specific type of whiskey, which is 1792 Whiskey.\n2. The geographical focus is on the United States.\n\nNext, we need to consider synonyms and related terms that might yield relevant results. For example, \"1792 Whiskey\" is a brand, and we might look for broader categories like \"bourbon\" or \"American whiskey\" since 1792 Whiskey falls under these categories.\n\nWe should also think about the context of spending.

The brand and distillery have been owned by the Sazerac Company since 2009. It is part of a line of small-batch bourbons aimed at the high-end liquor market. It is sold at 93.7 U.S. proof (46.85% alcohol by volume). The name of the bourbon is a reference to the year Kentucky became a state. The bourbon is positioned as a premium brand, and the pricing policy makes it a competitor to\"\n[2]: \"1792 Bourbon\" | \"Knob Creek or Woodford Reserve.

When originally introduced, the bourbon carried a \"\"Small Batch Aged 8 years\"\" statement on the back label and \"\"8-year-old\"\" in the text printed on the back of the bottle. In December 2013, the age statement was dropped from the label and replaced with the wording \"\"small batch bourbon whiskey\"\" and the term \"\"8-year-old\"\" was removed from the text. 1792 Bourbon was originally introduced into the market by Barton as \"\"Ridgewood Reserve 1792\"\".

Let's break down the information we have regarding 1792 Bourbon and the whiskey market in the United States.\n\n1. **Understanding 1792 Bourbon**: \n   - 1792 Bourbon is a Kentucky straight Bourbon whiskey produced by the Barton 1792 Distillery.\n   - It is positioned as a premium brand and competes with other high-end bourbons like Knob Creek and Woodford Reserve.\n\n2. **Market Context**:\n   - The context mentions that in 2014, U.S. bourbon whiskey exports surpassed $1 billion, indicating a significant market presence.\n   - The overall sales of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey in the U.S. generated almost $2.7 billion in wholesale distillery revenue.\n\n3. **Growth Trends**:\n   - The context highlights a trend of increasing sales in higher-end bourbons, with super-premium bourbons experiencing a growth of 137.2% from 2009 to 2014.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since 1792 Bourbon is categorized as a premium bourbon, it falls under the segment that contributes to the overall revenue of bourbon sales in the U.S.\n\nNow, based on this reasoning, we can conclude that the total spending on bourbon whiskey, including premium brands like 1792, is approximately $2.7 billion in the United States. \n\nShall I provide the final answer?"

The question asks about:\n\n1. The amount of money spent on a specific type of whiskey, which is 1792 Whiskey.\n2. The geographical focus is on the United States.\n\nNext, we need to consider synonyms and related terms that might yield relevant results. For example, \"1792 Whiskey\" is a brand, and we might look for broader categories like \"bourbon\" or \"American whiskey\" since 1792 Whiskey falls under these categories.\n\nWe should also think about the context of spending. This could involve looking for statistics on whiskey sales, market analysis reports, or consumer spending data.\n\nNow, let's structure the search query to encompass these elements. \n\nA well-structured search query might look like this:\n\n\"1792 Whiskey sales data United States\" OR \"1792 Bourbon spending statistics USA\" OR \"American whiskey market expenditures 2023\" OR \"whiskey consumer spending United States 2023\" \n\nThis query aims to cover various aspects of the question while being specific enough to retrieve relevant information. \n\nNow, let's finalize the search query based on this reasoning. \n\n**Final Search Query**: \n\"1792 Whiskey sales data United States\" OR \"1792 Bourbon spending statistics USA\" OR \"American whiskey market expenditures 2023\" OR \"whiskey consumer spending United States 2023\""
