This implies we need to gather data on spending, sales figures, market value, or consumer expenditure related to bourbon whiskey.\n\n4. **Contextual Keywords**: It may be helpful to include phrases related to market spending, whiskey consumption statistics, and industry reports to capture a broader scope of relevant documents.\n\n5. **Type of Information**: We are looking for external documents that provide financial statistics, market research reports, or articles discussing the economic aspects of whiskey consumption in the United States.\n\nNow, with these considerations in mind, we can formulate a search query that encompasses all these elements effectively.\n\n**search_query**: \"1792 Whiskey bourbon spending United States market analysis consumer expenditure sales figures whiskey industry report\"\n\nAnswer: \"1792 Whiskey bourbon spending United States market analysis consumer expenditure sales figures whiskey industry report\"\n        \n---\n\n** Worker Proposal 2 **\n\nRationale: \n: Let's solve this problem step by step before giving the final response\n\n\n: To construct an effective search query for the question, we need to break down the elements involved:\n\n1. **Type of Whiskey**: The question specifies \"1792 Whiskey,\" which is a type of bourbon whiskey. We'll need to include terms related to bourbon to capture relevant data.\n\n2. **Spending or Expenditure**: The query should focus on financial data, specifically how much is spent on bourbon whiskey in the United States.\n\n3. **Geographic Focus**: The location is specified as the United States, so we need to include that in our query to filter results appropriately.\n\n4. **Market Data**: Since the question pertains to spending, we should look for sources that discuss market analysis, sales figures, or industry reports regarding bourbon whiskey.\n\n5. **Current Trends**: The query might also benefit from including terms that relate to current trends or statistics to ensure we get up-to-date information.\n\nTaking these elements into account, a detailed search query could look something like this:\n\n**search_query**: \"1792 Whiskey bourbon spending statistics in the United States 2023 market analysis sales figures\"\n\nAnswer: \"1792 Whiskey bourbon spending statistics in the United States 2023 market analysis sales figures\"\n        "
