It's part of the small-batch bourbon segment aimed at the high-end liquor market.\n\n2. **Examine the Context for Financial Data**:\n   - The context mentions that bourbon and Tennessee whiskey generated almost $2.7 billion in wholesale distillery revenue in the U.S. for the year 2013. \n   - Additionally, it notes that U.S. bourbon whiskey exports surpassed $1 billion for the first time in 2013, indicating a strong market presence.\n\n3. **Growth of the Bourbon Market**:\n   - Between 2009 and 2014, the gross supplier revenues for U.S. bourbon and Tennessee whiskey increased significantly (by 46.7%). This suggests a growing consumer interest and financial investment in bourbons, particularly in higher-end products.\n\n4. **High-End Segment Growth**:\n   - The context specifies that super-premium bourbons (which would likely include brands like 1792 Bourbon) experienced the most substantial growth, with a reported increase of 137.2% during that period.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While specific figures for 1792 Bourbon alone are not provided, we can infer that the overall spending on high-end bourbons is a significant portion of the $2.7 billion generated from bourbon and Tennessee whiskey sales in the U.S.\n\nNow that we've analyzed the context, we can formulate a response to the question.

Specifically, the volume of whiskey, particularly higher-end bourbons, has seen considerable growth.\n\n3. **Revenue Generation**: In 2013, it was noted that U.S. exports of bourbon whiskey surpassed $1 billion. Additionally, in 2014, the total for U.S. bourbon whiskey exports was also around $1 billion, indicating a strong market presence for bourbon.\n\n4. **Growth Trends**: The context outlines growth percentages across various segments of whiskey. High-end bourbons and super-premium products experienced substantial growth during the 2009\u20132014 period, with super-premium bourbon seeing a growth of 137.2%.\n\n5. **Overall Revenue**: The gross supplier revenues for U.S. bourbon and Tennessee whiskey increased by 46.7% over the same period.\n\nNow, based on this information, we can deduce that the spending on bourbon whiskey, especially high-end varieties like 1792 Bourbon, is considerable, contributing significantly to the overall liquor market in the U.S.\n\nWith this reasoning in mind, let's formulate a clear answer to the question about how much is spent on the type of whiskey that 1792 Whiskey is in the United States. \n\nWould you like to proceed with the final response now?\n\nAnswer: Over $2.7 billion in wholesale revenue for bourbon and Tennessee whiskey in the U.S.\n        \n---\n\n** Worker Proposal 1 **\n\nRationale: \n: Let's solve this problem step by step before giving the final response\n\n\n: Certainly! Let\u2019s break down the information step by step to determine how much is spent on the type of whiskey that 1792 Bourbon belongs to.\n\n1. **Identify the Type of Whiskey**: \n   - 1792 Bourbon is categorized as a Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey. It's part of the small-batch bourbon segment aimed at the high-end liquor market.\n\n2. **Examine the Context for Financial Data**:\n   - The context mentions that bourbon and Tennessee whiskey generated almost $2.7 billion in wholesale distillery revenue in the U.S. for the year 2013. \n   - Additionally, it notes that U.S. bourbon whiskey exports surpassed $1 billion for the first time in 2013, indicating a strong market presence.\n\n3. **Growth of the Bourbon Market**:\n   - Between 2009 and 2014, the gross supplier revenues for U.S. bourbon and Tennessee whiskey increased significantly (by 46.7%). This suggests a growing consumer interest and financial investment in bourbons, particularly in higher-end products.\n\n4. **High-End Segment Growth**:\n   - The context specifies that super-premium bourbons (which would likely include brands like 1792 Bourbon) experienced the most substantial growth, with a reported increase of 137.2% during that period.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While specific figures for 1792 Bourbon alone are not provided, we can infer that the overall spending on high-end bourbons is a significant portion of the $2.7 billion generated from bourbon and Tennessee whiskey sales in the U.S.\n\nNow that we've analyzed the context, we can formulate a response to the question. Would you like to proceed with that?\n\nAnswer: Approximately $2.7 billion on bourbon and Tennessee whiskey in the U.S.\n        \n---\n\n** Worker Proposal 2 **\n\nRationale: \n: Let's solve this problem step by step before giving the final response\n\n\n: Certainly!

It's part of the small-batch bourbon segment aimed at the high-end liquor market.\n\n2. **Examine the Context for Financial Data**:\n   - The context mentions that bourbon and Tennessee whiskey generated almost $2.7 billion in wholesale distillery revenue in the U.S. for the year 2013. \n   - Additionally, it notes that U.S. bourbon whiskey exports surpassed $1 billion for the first time in 2013, indicating a strong market presence.\n\n3. **Growth of the Bourbon Market**:\n   - Between 2009 and 2014, the gross supplier revenues for U.S. bourbon and Tennessee whiskey increased significantly (by 46.7%). This suggests a growing consumer interest and financial investment in bourbons, particularly in higher-end products.\n\n4. **High-End Segment Growth**:\n   - The context specifies that super-premium bourbons (which would likely include brands like 1792 Bourbon) experienced the most substantial growth, with a reported increase of 137.2% during that period.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - While specific figures for 1792 Bourbon alone are not provided, we can infer that the overall spending on high-end bourbons is a significant portion of the $2.7 billion generated from bourbon and Tennessee whiskey sales in the U.S.\n\nNow that we've analyzed the context, we can formulate a response to the question.

We want to find credible sources that provide details about John Laub's current position, the university he is affiliated with, and the founding year of that institution. \n\nGiven this breakdown, our search query should include these elements, and we should aim to retrieve information about both John Laub and the university's history.\n\nNow, let's formulate the search query:\n\n**Search Query:**\n\"John Laub American criminologist Distinguished University Professor Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice university founded year\""
