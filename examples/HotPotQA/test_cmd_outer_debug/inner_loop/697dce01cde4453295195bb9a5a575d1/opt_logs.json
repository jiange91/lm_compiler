This involves both identifying the institution and its founding year.\n\n3. **Contextual Keywords**: We\u2019ll need keywords that represent the key subjects of the query, including:\n   - John Laub\n   - American criminologist\n   - Distinguished University Professor\n   - Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice\n   - Founding year of the institution\n\n4. **Search Scope**: Since the question is specific to John Laub's professional affiliation, we want to include terms related to his position and the academic department to ensure we find sources that provide accurate historical context about the institution.\n\nBased on this reasoning, a detailed search query could be structured as follows:\n\n**Search Query**: \"John Laub American criminologist Distinguished University Professor Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice founding year\" \n\nThis query is designed to retrieve information about John Laub's academic position and the founding year of the associated institution. It includes specific terms that will help narrow down the search to relevant documents or sources.\n\nAnswer: \"John Laub American criminologist Distinguished University Professor Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice founding year\"\n        \n---\n\n** Worker Proposal 2 **\n\nRationale: \n: Let's solve this problem step by step before giving the final response\n\n\n: To construct an effective search query for the given question, we need to identify the key components and context.\n\n1. **Key Individuals**: The question mentions John Laub, who is identified as an American criminologist. We need to gather information about him and his professional affiliations.\n\n2. **Institution**: The question specifies that he is a Distinguished University Professor in the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice. This implies we need to find out which university he is affiliated with and the specific department.\n\n3. **Founding Year**: The main focus of the question is to find out the year in which this institution (presumably the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice) was founded.\n\nBased on these components, the search query should aim to find the following:\n- Information about John Laub's academic position.\n- The name of the university associated with him.\n- The founding year of the Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice at that university.\n\nNow, let\u2019s craft a detailed search query that encompasses all these elements:\n\n**Search Query**: \"John Laub American criminologist Distinguished University Professor Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice founding year university\"\n\nThis search query should lead to results that provide comprehensive information about John Laub, the university he is associated with, and the founding year of the relevant department.\n\nAnswer: \"John Laub American criminologist Distinguished University Professor Department of Criminology and Criminal Justice founding year university\"\n        "

In December 2013, the age statement was dropped from the label and replaced with the wording \"\"small batch bourbon whiskey\"\" and the term \"\"8-year-old\"\" was removed from the text. 1792 Bourbon was originally introduced into the market by Barton as \"\"Ridgewood Reserve 1792\"\".
