The brand and distillery have been owned by the Sazerac Company since 2009. It is part of a line of small-batch bourbons aimed at the high-end liquor market. It is sold at 93.7 U.S. proof (46.85% alcohol by volume). The name of the bourbon is a reference to the year Kentucky became a state. The bourbon is positioned as a premium brand, and the pricing policy makes it a competitor to\"\n[2]: \"Bourbon whiskey\" | \"than 19 million nine-liter cases of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey were sold in the U.S., generating almost $2.7 billion in wholesale distillery revenue. U.S. exports of bourbon whiskey surpassed $1 billion for the first time in 2013; distillers hailed the rise of a \"\"golden age of Kentucky bourbon\"\" and predicted further growth. In 2014, it was estimated that U.S. bourbon whiskey exports surpassed $1 billion, making up the majority of the U.S. total of $1.6 billion in spirits exports. Major export markets for U.S. spirits are, in descending order: Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and France. The largest percentage\"\n[3]: \"Bourbon whiskey\" | \"is strongly associated with the American South and with Kentucky in particular. As of 2014, distillers' wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. was about $2.7 billion, and bourbon made up about two-thirds of the $1.6 billion of U.S. exports of distilled spirits. Distilling was most likely brought to present-day Kentucky in the late 18th century by Scots, Scots-Irish, and other settlers (including English, Irish, Welsh, German, and French) who began to farm the area in earnest. The origin of bourbon as a distinct form of whiskey is not well documented. There are many conflicting legends and claims,\"",

The question asks about the expenditure on a specific type of whiskey, namely 1792 Whiskey, within the United States. \n\nHere are the elements we need to consider:\n\n1. **Type of Whiskey**: The question specifically mentions \"1792 Whiskey,\" which is a brand. We should ensure that our query reflects that we are interested in this particular brand and its classification.\n  \n2. **Expenditure**: The question seeks information about spending or financial data, suggesting that we should look for statistics, reports, or articles that discuss sales figures or market analysis.\n\n3. **Geographic Focus**: The United States is mentioned, indicating that we want information specific to this country and not global or international figures.\n\n4. **Market Context**: It may be relevant to include terms related to whiskey market trends, consumer spending, or average prices to ensure we capture a broad spectrum of relevant data.\n\nNow, considering these components, we can formulate our search query. This will include terms that focus on the expenditure related to 1792 Whiskey in the U.S., alongside market analysis or financial statistics.\n\nThe next step is to combine these elements into a structured search query. \n\nHere is the detailed search query based on the outlined reasoning:\n\n**search_query**: \"1792 Whiskey expenditure United States market analysis sales figures consumer spending 2023\"\n\nAnswer: \"1792 Whiskey expenditure United States market analysis sales figures consumer spending 2023\"\n        \n---\n\n** Worker Proposal 1 **\n\nRationale: \n: Let's solve this problem step by step before giving the final response\n\n\n: Sure!

The brand and distillery have been owned by the Sazerac Company since 2009. It is part of a line of small-batch bourbons aimed at the high-end liquor market.

In 2014, it was estimated that U.S. bourbon whiskey exports surpassed $1 billion, making up the majority of the U.S. total of $1.6 billion in spirits exports. Major export markets for U.S. spirits are, in descending order: Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and France.

As of 2014, distillers' wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. was about $2.7 billion, and bourbon made up about two-thirds of the $1.6 billion of U.S. exports of distilled spirits. Distilling was most likely brought to present-day Kentucky in the late 18th century by Scots, Scots-Irish, and other settlers (including English, Irish, Welsh, German, and French) who began to farm the area in earnest. The origin of bourbon as a distinct form of whiskey is not well documented. There are many conflicting legends and claims,\"",

The brand and distillery have been owned by the Sazerac Company since 2009. It is part of a line of small-batch bourbons aimed at the high-end liquor market.

In 2014, it was estimated that U.S. bourbon whiskey exports surpassed $1 billion, making up the majority of the U.S. total of $1.6 billion in spirits exports. Major export markets for U.S. spirits are, in descending order: Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and France.

As of 2014, distillers' wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. was about $2.7 billion, and bourbon made up about two-thirds of the $1.6 billion of U.S. exports of distilled spirits. Distilling was most likely brought to present-day Kentucky in the late 18th century by Scots, Scots-Irish, and other settlers (including English, Irish, Welsh, German, and French) who began to farm the area in earnest. The origin of bourbon as a distinct form of whiskey is not well documented. There are many conflicting legends and claims,\"",
