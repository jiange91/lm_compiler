They do not share a direct profession, but they can both be considered public figures in their respective fields.\n\n4. **Formulating the Search Query**: The search query should include both names and a phrase that captures the essence of what they are considered. The proposals suggest variations of this, with some focusing on the phrase \"what are they considered\" and others on \"considered as.\"\n\n5. **Consensus from Proposals**: \n   - Proposals 0 and 1 suggest the search query: \"Brian Warren Jake Shields what are they considered.\"\n   - Proposal 2 offers a slightly different phrasing: \"Brian Warren Jake Shields considered as.\"\n\n6. **Final Decision**: The most straightforward and clear search query that encapsulates the question while maintaining coherence is the one that directly asks what they are considered, as it aligns with the original question format.\n\n**Final Search Query**: \"Brian Warren Jake Shields what are they considered\"\n\nThis query effectively captures the essence of the question and is likely to yield relevant results regarding the common characteristics or classifications of both individuals."

Let's break down the task step by step to formulate an effective search query based on the provided context and question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Context\n1. **Film Title**: The context mentions \"The Sword in the Stone,\" which is a 1963 American animated film produced by Walt Disney.\n2. **Production Company**: The film was produced by Walt Disney Productions.\n3. **Distribution Company**: It was released by Buena Vista Distribution.\n4. **Songwriters**: The Sherman Brothers wrote the songs for this film.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Question\n- The question asks for the company that distributed a specific **1977 American animated film** produced by Walt Disney Productions and for which the Sherman Brothers wrote songs.\n- The context does not explicitly mention a 1977 film but indicates that the Sherman Brothers wrote songs for various Disney films.\n\n### Step 3: Determine Relevant Details\n- We need to clarify which 1977 animated film is being referred to in the question. However, from the context, we know that \"The Sword in the Stone\" is not from 1977 but rather from 1963.\n- The context does not provide details about a 1977 film specifically, but it does suggest that the Sherman Brothers were involved in Disney films.\n\n### Step 4: Formulate the Search Query\nTo answer the question effectively, we need to focus on:\n- The **1977 animated film** produced by Walt Disney Productions.\n- The **company that distributed it**.\n\nSince the context mentions \"The Sword in the Stone\" and the Sherman Brothers, we can assume that the query should focus on identifying the distributor of the 1977 film, which we can infer is also likely distributed by Buena Vista Distribution.\n\n### Final Search Query\nBased on the analysis, the search query can be formulated as:\n**\"1977 American animated film produced by Walt Disney Productions distributor\"**\n\nThis query aims to retrieve information about the distributor of the 1977 animated film produced by Walt Disney Productions.\n\n### Final Answer\n{search_query: \"1977 American animated film produced by Walt Disney Productions distributor\"}"

Let's break down the task step by step to create a comprehensive and accurate search query based on the provided context and question.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Context\nThe context discusses the album \"Riders in the Sky Present: Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier,\" which was released on August 3, 2004. However, it is important to note that this is not a movie; it is a studio recording by the Western band Riders in the Sky. The context provides background on Davy Crockett as a historical figure but does not mention any movie release dates.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Key Elements in the Question\nThe question asks which movie was released first: \"Son of Flubber\" or \"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier.\" This requires us to find the release dates of both films to determine which one came out first.\n\n### Step 3: Extract Relevant Information\n- **\"Son of Flubber\"**: We need to find its release date.\n- **\"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier\"**: Although the context mentions an album with this title, we need to clarify that we are looking for the movie release date, not the album.\n\n### Step 4: Review Worker Proposals\nThe worker agent provided three proposals:\n1. **Proposal 0**: \"Son of Flubber release date\" AND \"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier release date\"\n2. **Proposal 1**: \"Son of Flubber release date, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier release date\"\n3. **Proposal 2**: \"Son of Flubber release date Davy Crockett King of the Wild Frontier release date\"\n\n### Step 5: Identify Points of Agreement\n- All proposals focus on finding the release dates for both films.\n- They all mention \"Son of Flubber\" and \"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier.\"\n\n### Step 6: Resolve Discrepancies\n- Proposal 0 uses \"AND,\" which is a clear way to indicate that both queries are needed.\n- Proposals 1 and 2 use a comma or space, which is less formal but still conveys the same intent.\n\n### Step 7: Craft the Final Search Query\nBased on the analysis, the final search query should be clear and effective in retrieving the necessary information. The most coherent and widely agreed-upon phrasing would be:\n\n**Final Search Query**: \"Son of Flubber release date\" AND \"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier release date\"\n\nThis query effectively captures the necessary details to retrieve precise information regarding the release dates of both films.\n\n### Final Response\nThe effective search query to find the release dates of both movies is: \n**\"Son of Flubber release date\" AND \"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier release date\"**"

He was inspired by Moravian and other Slavic folk music to create an original, modern musical style. Until 1895 he devoted himself mainly to folkloristic research. While his early musical output was influenced by contemporaries such as Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, his later, mature works incorporate his earlier studies of national folk music in a modern, highly original synthesis, first evident in the opera \"\"Jen\u016ffa\"\", which was premiered in 1904 in Brno.
