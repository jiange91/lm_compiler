This indicates that the last publication year for \"Who Put The Bomp\" was 1979.\n   - The context does not provide any details about \"Self,\" so we need to consider that we don't have specific information about its publication dates.\n\n2. **Determining the Publication Years**:\n   - From the context, we know \"Who Put The Bomp\" ceased publication in 1979.\n   - Without additional information about \"Self,\" we cannot compare the two directly.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - If \"Self\" is still being published or was published after 1979, it would be the more recent publication. If it was published before 1979, then \"Who Put the Bomp\" would be the most recent.\n\nSince we do not have sufficient context about \"Self,\" we can generate a search query that would help find information regarding its publication timeline.\n\n**Final Response**:\nsearch_query:\n\"Self magazine publication date\"\n\nAnswer: search_query:\n\"Self magazine publication date\"\n        "
