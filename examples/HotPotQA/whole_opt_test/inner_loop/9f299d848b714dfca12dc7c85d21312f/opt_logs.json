However, this is not the movie itself but rather an album tribute. The actual movie \"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier\" was released by Disney in 1955.\n\n2. **Son of Flubber**: This film is a sequel to \"The Absent-Minded Professor\" and was released by Disney on February 12, 1963.\n\nNow, comparing the two release years:\n- \"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier\" was released in 1955.\n- \"Son of Flubber\" was released in 1963.\n\nSince 1955 is earlier than 1963, we can conclude that \"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier\" was released first.\n\nFinal response: Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier."
