Divided by disagreements over story and production values, Goldman, along with Bluth and Pomeroy, resigned from Walt Disney Productions to establish their independent animation studio, Don Bluth Productions, in 1979. The departure was highly publicized and the trio was dubbed \"\"Disney Defectors\"\" by news reporters. Since leaving Disney, the team produced several feature films, starting with \"\"The Secret of NIMH\"\", which won the Saturn Award for \"\"Best Animated Feature\"\" from the Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Film Academy. In late 1982, composer Jerry Goldsmith introduced them to director Steven Spielberg. Their first collaboration with Spielberg, which began\"', '\"An American Tail\" | \"that of \"\"The Land Before Time\"\" and Disney\\'s \"\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\"\", and Bluth\\'s departure from their partnership, prompted Steven Spielberg to establish his own animation studio, Amblimation. In Shostka in 1885, the Mousekewitzes, a Russian-Jewish family of mice who live with a human family named Moskowitz, are having a celebration of Hanukkah where Papa gives his hat to his 5-year-old son, Fievel, and tells him about the United States, a country where there are no cats. The celebration is interrupted when a battery of Cossacks ride through the village square in an anti-Jewish arson attack and their cats likewise\"']",

Let's break down the context and the question step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: \n   - The context mentions Gary Goldman and his involvement with Don Bluth Productions after leaving Walt Disney Productions. \n   - It also references several films produced by this team, including \"The Secret of NIMH,\" \"An American Tail,\" and \"The Land Before Time.\"\n   - It notes that the success of these films, particularly in relation to Steven Spielberg, led to Spielberg establishing his own animation studio, Amblimation.\n\n2. **Identifying Key Information**:\n   - The question asks for the director of the film that contributed to the success prompting Spielberg to create his animation studio.\n   - The films mentioned are \"An American Tail\" and \"The Land Before Time,\" but the context does not explicitly state who directed these films.\n\n3. **Connecting the Dots**:\n   - Since the question is about the director of the film whose success led to Spielberg's decision, we need to identify the directors of \"An American Tail\" and \"The Land Before Time.\"\n   - \"An American Tail\" was directed by Don Bluth, and \"The Land Before Time\" was also directed by Don Bluth.\n\n4. **Formulating the Search Query**:\n   - The search query should focus on finding out who directed the films that led to Spielberg's establishment of his animation studio.\n\nNow, let's create the search query based on this reasoning. \n\nsearch_query: \"director of An American Tail and The Land Before Time Don Bluth\""
