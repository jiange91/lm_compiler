Don Bluth, who had partnered with Steven Spielberg on both the original film and \"\"The Land Before Time\"\", was set to direct and have Sullivan Bluth Studios provide the animation; owing to creative differences, however, they parted ways. With no Bluth in sight for the sequel, Spielberg instead relied on Phil Nibbelink, a former Disney animator, and Simon Wells, the great-grandson of science-fiction author H. G. Wells, to direct the project. The result was that the film's animation style was distinctly different\"\n[2]: \"Disney Renaissance\" | \"and became the higher-grossing film on its first release. Despite \"\"An American Tail\"\"s greater level of success, \"\"The Great Mouse Detective\"\" was still successful enough (both critically and commercially) to instill executive confidence in Disney's animation department. Two years later, \"\"Oliver and Company\"\" successfully outgrossed \"\"The Land Before Time\"\", launching an era of increased theatrical turnout for the studio. In 1988, Disney collaborated with Steven Spielberg, a long-time animation fan and producer of \"\"An American Tail\"\" and \"\"The Land Before Time\"\", to produce \"\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\"\", a live action/animation hybrid which featured animated characters from the 1930s and 1940s\"\n[3]: \"Walt Disney Animation Studios\" | \"\"\"Time\"\" and went on to become the most successful animated feature to that date.
