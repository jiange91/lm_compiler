Let's break down the context and the question step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The context provides information about two ballets created by George Balanchine: \"Square Dance\" and \"Chaconne.\" It mentions that in 1976, Balanchine added Arcangelo Corelli's music to \"Square Dance.\" However, the context does not explicitly state that Corelli is the Italian composer referred to in the question.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks specifically for the name of the Italian composer that Balanchine added in 1976. The context mentions Corelli's addition to \"Square Dance,\" which suggests he is the composer in question.\n\n3. **Identifying Gaps**: While the context does mention Corelli, it does not directly confirm that he is the Italian composer referred to in the question. Therefore, it would be prudent to verify this information to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Formulating a Search Query**: To confirm that Arcangelo Corelli is indeed the Italian composer added by Balanchine in 1976, we can create a search query that targets this specific information.\n\nNow, let's create the search query based on this reasoning. \n\n**search_query**: \"Arcangelo Corelli added by George Balanchine 1976\""

Let's break down the context and the question step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Context**: The context provides information about two ballets created by George Balanchine: \"Square Dance\" and \"Chaconne.\" It mentions that in 1976, Balanchine added Arcangelo Corelli's music to \"Square Dance.\" However, the context does not explicitly state that Corelli is the Italian composer referred to in the question.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Question**: The question asks specifically for the name of the Italian composer that Balanchine added in 1976. The context mentions Corelli's addition to \"Square Dance,\" which suggests he is the composer in question.\n\n3. **Identifying Gaps**: While the context does mention Corelli, it does not directly confirm that he is the Italian composer referred to in the question. Therefore, it would be prudent to verify this information to ensure accuracy.\n\n4. **Formulating a Search Query**: To confirm that Arcangelo Corelli is indeed the Italian composer added by Balanchine in 1976, we can create a search query that targets this specific information.\n\nNow, let's create the search query based on this reasoning. \n\n**search_query**: \"Arcangelo Corelli added by George Balanchine 1976\""

It also mentions that PSUT is a non-profit institution owned by the Royal Scientific Society and that it aims to support technology commercialization and entrepreneurship development.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Question**: \n   - The question asks whether Princess Sumaya University for Technology and Tennessee Technological University are from the same country. To answer this, we need to know the location of Tennessee Technological University.\n\n3. **Identifying Missing Information**: \n   - The context does not provide any information about Tennessee Technological University, including its location. Therefore, we need to find additional sources that can confirm where Tennessee Technological University is located.\n\n4. **Formulating a Search Query**: \n   - To find the missing information, we need to create a search query that specifically targets the location of Tennessee Technological University.\n\nNow that we've reasoned through the context and the question, we can proceed to formulate the search query. \n\nWhat would you like to include in the search query?"
