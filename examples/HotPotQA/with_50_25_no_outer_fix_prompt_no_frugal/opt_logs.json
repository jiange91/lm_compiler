We need to determine which film this is, as it is central to the query.\n\n2. **Songwriters**: The Sherman Brothers are mentioned as the songwriters for this film. This detail may help narrow down the search to films associated with them.\n\n3. **Distributor**: The main focus of the question is to find out which company distributed the film. This is a specific piece of information that we need to extract from external sources.\n\n4. **Contextual Keywords**: We should include keywords related to the film's production, the Sherman Brothers, and distribution to ensure we capture relevant documents.\n\nNow, let's formulate a search query that encapsulates all these elements. \n\n**Search Query**: \n\"1977 American animated film Walt Disney Productions Sherman Brothers songs distributor company\""

We want to ensure that the search query is specific enough to retrieve relevant information about the song, its album, and the associated record label.\n\nNext, we can formulate the search query. \n\nsearch_query: \"Everything Has Changed song album record label\""

The film was directed by Robert Stevenson and its screenplay written by Lawrence Edward Watkin after the books of Herminie Templeton Kavanagh. The film\\'s title is a slight modification of one of the two Kavanagh books, \"\"Darby O\\'Gill and the Good People\"\". This book and her other book, \"\"The Ashes of Old Wishes And Other Darby\"', '\"Darby O\\'Gill and the Little People\" | \"the wagon for a happy ending, with Michael and Katie singing a final duet together of \"\"Pretty Irish Girl.\"\" The film\\'s development began with a visit to Ireland and the Irish Folklore Commission by Walt Disney and associates in 1947. The Disney company continued to liaise with the commission and its director, James Delargy, over the coming decade based on Disney\\'s desire to use Irish folklore as the basis of a film but, to Delargy\\'s disappointment, eventually decided to make an adaptation of Irish-American writer Hermione Templeton Kavanagh\\'s 1903 collection of stories \"\"Darbie O\\'Gill and the Good People\"\".

In 1959, the Walt Disney adapted Kavanaugh\\'s works to the silver screen under the title \"\"Darby O\\'Gill and the Little People\"\". In the film, O\\'Gill is an aging groundskeeper who engages in a friendly battle of wits with a leprechaun king, and is played by the actor Albert Sharpe. At least two American Irish-music bands have taken O\\'Gill\\'s name under\"', '\"Darby O\\'Gill\" | \"which to perform. Darby O\\'Gill operates in Portland, Oregon, while Darby O\\'Gill and the Little People center their performances in Las Vegas. Apart from the use of the name, the two bands have no connection.

Let's break down the question to identify the key elements that will help us construct an effective search query.\n\n1. **Key Individuals**: The question mentions two specific individuals: Tim Kennedy and Jason Miller. We need to gather information about both of them.\n\n2. **Context**: The focus is on their fighting careers, specifically regarding championships. This implies we need to look for information related to their records in terms of championships fought.\n\n3. **Comparison**: The question is comparative, asking who has fought in the most championships. This suggests that we should look for statistics or records that detail the number of championships each fighter has participated in.\n\nNow, let's formulate a search query that encapsulates these elements:\n\nsearch_query:\nsearch_query: \"Tim Kennedy Jason Miller fight record championships comparison\""
