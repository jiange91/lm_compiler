During these years, he worked with composers such as Sergei Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, Claude Debussy, Erik Satie, and Maurice Ravel, and artists who designed sets and costumes, such as Pablo Picasso, Georges Rouault, and Henri Matisse, creating new works that combined all the arts. Among his new works, during 1928 in Paris, Balanchine premiered \"\"Apollon musag\u00e8te\"\" (Apollo and the muses) in a collaboration with Stravinsky; it was one of his most innovative ballets, combining classical ballet and classical Greek myth and images with jazz movement.

During these years, he worked with composers such as Sergei Prokofiev, Igor Stravinsky, Claude Debussy, Erik Satie, and Maurice Ravel, and artists who designed sets and costumes, such as Pablo Picasso, Georges Rouault, and Henri Matisse, creating new works that combined all the arts. Among his new works, during 1928 in Paris, Balanchine premiered \"\"Apollon musag\u00e8te\"\" (Apollo and the muses) in a collaboration with Stravinsky; it was one of his most innovative ballets, combining classical ballet and classical Greek myth and images with jazz movement. He described it as \"\"the turning point in\"\n[2]: \"Square Dance (ballet)\" | \"Square Dance (ballet) Square Dance is a ballet made by New York City Ballet co-founder and balletmaster George Balanchine to Antonio Vivaldi's \"\"Concerto Grosso in B minor\"\" and the first movement of his \"\"Concerto Grosso in E major\"\", Op. 3, nos. 10 and 12, respectively; in 1976 he added Arcangelo Corelli's \"\"Sarabanda, Badinerie e Giga\"\", second and third movements. The premiere took place on November 21, 1957, at City Center of Music and Drama, New York, with lighting by Mark Stanley. The original version placed the musicians on stage with a square dance caller calling the steps; from its 1976\"\n[3]: \"Square Dance (ballet)\" | \"revival the caller was eliminated, the orchestra placed in the pit, and a solo added for the \"\"premier danseur\"\" to the Corelli \"\"Sarabanda\"\". The Pacific Northwest Ballet restored the caller for one performance at the 2007 Vail International Dance Festival.
