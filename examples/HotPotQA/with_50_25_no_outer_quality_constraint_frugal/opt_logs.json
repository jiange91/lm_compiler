With no Bluth in sight for the sequel, Spielberg instead relied on Phil Nibbelink, a former Disney animator, and Simon Wells, the great-grandson of science-fiction author H. G.

A Dinosaur's Story\"\", \"\"Balto\"\", and a screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"\"Cats\"\" which never saw completion. Don Bluth, who had partnered with Steven Spielberg on both the original film and \"\"The Land Before Time\"\", was set to direct and have Sullivan Bluth Studios provide the animation; owing to creative differences, however, they parted ways. With no Bluth in sight for the sequel, Spielberg instead relied on Phil Nibbelink, a former Disney animator, and Simon Wells, the great-grandson of science-fiction author H. G. Wells, to direct the project. The result was that the film's animation style was distinctly different\"\n[2]: \"Disney Renaissance\" | \"and became the higher-grossing film on its first release. Despite \"\"An American Tail\"\"s greater level of success, \"\"The Great Mouse Detective\"\" was still successful enough (both critically and commercially) to instill executive confidence in Disney's animation department. Two years later, \"\"Oliver and Company\"\" successfully outgrossed \"\"The Land Before Time\"\", launching an era of increased theatrical turnout for the studio. In 1988, Disney collaborated with Steven Spielberg, a long-time animation fan and producer of \"\"An American Tail\"\" and \"\"The Land Before Time\"\", to produce \"\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\"\", a live action/animation hybrid which featured animated characters from the 1930s and 1940s\"\n[3]: \"Walt Disney Animation Studios\" | \"\"\"Time\"\" and went on to become the most successful animated feature to that date. At the same time in 1988, Disney's started entering into Australia's long-standing animation industry, by purchasing Hanna-Barbera's Australian studio to start Disney Animation Australia. While \"\"Oliver & Company\"\" and the next feature \"\"The Little Mermaid\"\" were in production, Disney collaborated with Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment and master animator Richard Williams to produce \"\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\"\", a groundbreaking live-action/animation hybrid directed by Robert Zemeckis, which featured licensed animated characters from other animation studios. Disney set up a new animation studio under Williams' supervision in London to\"\n[4]: \"Disney Renaissance\" | \"from many different studios together. The film was a critical and commercial success, winning three Academy Awards for technical achievements and renewing interest in theatrical animated cartoons. Other than the film itself, Spielberg also helped Disney produce three \"\"Roger Rabbit\"\" shorts. Disney moved to first place in box office receipts by 1988, with \"\"Roger Rabbit\"\" being the summer's biggest hit. Disney had been developing \"\"The Little Mermaid\"\" since the 1930s, and by 1988, after the success of \"\"Roger Rabbit\"\", the studio had decided to make it into an animated musical, much like many of its previous animated movies, but with\"",

A Dinosaur's Story\"\", \"\"Balto\"\", and a screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"\"Cats\"\" which never saw completion. Don Bluth, who had partnered with Steven Spielberg on both the original film and \"\"The Land Before Time\"\", was set to direct and have Sullivan Bluth Studios provide the animation; owing to creative differences, however, they parted ways. With no Bluth in sight for the sequel, Spielberg instead relied on Phil Nibbelink, a former Disney animator, and Simon Wells, the great-grandson of science-fiction author H. G. Wells, to direct the project. The result was that the film's animation style was distinctly different\"\n[2]: \"Disney Renaissance\" | \"and became the higher-grossing film on its first release. Despite \"\"An American Tail\"\"s greater level of success, \"\"The Great Mouse Detective\"\" was still successful enough (both critically and commercially) to instill executive confidence in Disney's animation department. Two years later, \"\"Oliver and Company\"\" successfully outgrossed \"\"The Land Before Time\"\", launching an era of increased theatrical turnout for the studio. In 1988, Disney collaborated with Steven Spielberg, a long-time animation fan and producer of \"\"An American Tail\"\" and \"\"The Land Before Time\"\", to produce \"\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\"\", a live action/animation hybrid which featured animated characters from the 1930s and 1940s\"",
