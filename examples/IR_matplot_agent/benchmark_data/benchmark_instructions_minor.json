The data is named \"data.csv\". The data contains three columns: \"Year,\" \"Date,\" and \"Temperature.\" Here are My specific requirements for the visualization:\n- The diagram should be divided into 12 sectors, corresponding to the months of the year.\n- Temperature data should be plotted on the diagram according to the month.\n- The points representing the temperature data should be circular.\n- These points should be slightly offset so as not to align on a single radial line, with each point for the 1st of a month positioned between that month and the next. The offset should range from 0 to \u03c0/6 radians.\n- Month labels should be abbreviated (Jan, Feb, Mar, etc.) instead of numerical (1, 2, 3, etc.).\n- A blue curve should connect the data points for the year 2015 to distinguish it from other years.\n- The legend should be moved to the right to avoid overlapping the diagram.\nThe diagram will serve as a clear visual representation of temperature trends and variations by month over several years, with particular emphasis on the data from 2015."

        "simple_instruction": "I want to create a phase diagram of water using Python. The data is in a file called 'data.csv'.\n\n- First, you should set up the chart with a horizontal axis for temperature and a vertical axis for pressure. These should be marked in Celsius, Kelvin, Pascals, bars and millibars, with conversions where necessary.\n- Next, you should use the data to draw the lines that separate the solid, liquid, and gas phases of water. Use columns 1 and 2 of data to draw the line that separates the solid, liquid, and gas phases. Use columns 3 and 4 to draw the line that separates the solid and liquid phases.\n- You should also mark two special points: the triple point at 273.16 K and 611.657 Pa, where solid, liquid, and gas coexist, and the critical point at 647.396 K and 22.064 MPa, where there's no difference between liquid and gas.\n- You should draw two vertical red lines to show the freezing and boiling points of water at normal pressure.\n- Make sure to label everything clearly, and color the different regions to show the solid, liquid, and gas phases.\n- Finally, you should add a grid to make the chart easier to read, and ensure the pressure scale is logarithmic, since phase diagrams often cover a wide range of pressures.",
        "expert_instruction": "Write a python script to draw the phase diagram of water with the provided data, named \"data.csv\":\n1. Prepare the Axes:\n- Create a horizontal axis for temperature, marking one scale in Celsius (0\u00b0C to 100\u00b0C) and another in Kelvin (273.15 K to 647.396 K). These scales should be aligned so that each temperature in Celsius matches its corresponding value in Kelvin.\n- Create a vertical axis for pressure, marking one scale in Pascals (from 611.657 Pa to 22.064 MPa, possibly using a logarithmic scale for better visualization) and another in bars and millibars. Align these scales so that, for example, 100 kPa corresponds with 1 bar.\n- Set X1 to x1 - 273.15 to convert Kelvin to Celsius for the top X-axis. Set Y1 to y1/100000 to convert Pascals to bars for the right Y-axis. Adjust the right Y-axis to have a Log10 scale type.\n2. Plot the Phase Boundaries:\n- Utilize columns 1 and 2 from your data to plot the boundary line between the solid, liquid, and gas phases, curving from the triple point to the critical point.\n- Use columns 3 and 4 to plot the boundary between solid and liquid phases, which typically curves less dramatically than the solid-liquid-gas line.\n3. Highlight Special Points:\n- Mark the triple point at 273.16 K and 611.657 Pa, where solid, liquid, and gas coexist.\n- Indicate the critical point at 647.396 K and 22.064 MPa, where the distinction between liquid and gas phases ends.\n4. Insert Red Lines:\n- Draw a vertical red line at 0\u00b0C and 273.15 K to represent the freezing point at 1 atm, intersecting the solid-liquid boundary.\n- Add another vertical red line at 100\u00b0C and 373.15 K for the boiling point at 1 atm, intersecting the liquid-gas boundary.\n5. Label and Color-Code:\n- Clearly label each axis with its respective units.\n- Color the different regions of the diagram to represent the solid (blue), liquid (green), and gas (yellow) phases.\n- Annotate the diagram with the special points and the red lines, including their corresponding temperature and pressure values.\n6. Grid and Scale:\n- It may be helpful to include a grid to accurately read off pressures and temperatures at various points on the diagram.\n- Ensure that the scale is logarithmic for pressure if you are spanning wide ranges, as phase diagrams often do."

Color Settings:\n  - Decide how see-through you want the link colors to be.\n  - Choose colors for each energy type or process, making sure they are a bit see-through too.\n3. Set Up Nodes:\n  - Nodes are the boxes or points that represent different types of energy or processes. Make sure each has a label and color.\n  - Adjust how far apart and how thick each node is.\n4. Set Up Links:\n  - Links are the arrows or lines that show the energy moving from one node to another. Make sure each has a starting point, an ending point, how much energy it represents, and a color.\n  - The color of the links should match the energy source or process it's coming from but a bit lighter.\n5.
