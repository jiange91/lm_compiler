        "rationale": "Prompt 1 requires the agent to decompose a user query into multiple sub-queries that cover comprehensive aspects of the original query without too much overlap. This involves non-trivial reasoning and planning to ensure the sub-queries are distinct yet comprehensive. Additionally, generating short passages for each sub-query adds another layer of complexity."

        "rationale": "Prompt 3 involves evaluating the quality of an answer based on specific criteria. This requires vertical reasoning and decision-making to follow the grading order. However, each sub-task (checking if the answer addresses the question, if the knowledge is relevant, and if the answer is grounded) is relatively simple."

        "score": 2,
        "rationale": "Prompt 2 involves answering a user question based on provided Q&A pairs. While it requires understanding and synthesizing information from the context, the task is relatively straightforward as it relies on existing expert-written answers. The horizontal sub-tasks are simple to tackle."

        "score": 2,
        "rationale": "Prompt 5 involves assessing the relevance of a document to a user question based on keywords or semantic meaning. This task has multiple horizontal sub-tasks (checking for keywords and semantic meaning), but each sub-task is simple and does not require complex reasoning."

        "rationale": "Prompt 4 is straightforward as it involves answering a question using provided context. The task is simple and clear, with the main challenge being to keep the answer concise and within three sentences."
