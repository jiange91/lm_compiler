        "problem": "The cards in a stack of $2n$ cards are numbered consecutively from 1 through $2n$ from top to bottom. The top $n$ cards are removed, kept in order, and form pile $A.$ The remaining cards form pile $B.$ The cards are then restacked by taking cards alternately from the tops of pile $B$ and $A,$ respectively. In this process, card number $(n+1)$ becomes the bottom card of the new stack, card number 1 is on top of this card, and so on, until piles $A$ and $B$ are exhausted. If, after the restacking process, at least one card from each pile occupies the same position that it occupied in the original stack, the stack is named magical. For example, eight cards form a magical stack because cards number 3 and number 6 retain their original positions. Find the number of cards in the magical stack in which card number 131 retains its original position.\n",
        "solution": "Since a card from B is placed on the bottom of the new stack, notice that cards from pile B will be marked as an even number in the new pile, while cards from pile A will be marked as odd in the new pile. Since 131 is odd and retains its original position in the stack, it must be in pile A. Also to retain its original position, exactly $131 - 1 = 130$ numbers must be in front of it. There are $\\frac{130}{2} = 65$ cards from each of piles A, B in front of card 131. This suggests that $n = 131 + 65 = 196$; the total number of cards is $196 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{392}$."

The maximum we can't get is $5 \\times 3-5-3=7$, so the numbers $94 \\times 5-8$ and below, except $3$ and $1$, work.

For each configuration, we can subtract $i-1$ from the $i$-th element in your subset. This converts your configuration into a configuration with $k$ elements where the largest possible element is $n-k+1$, with no restriction on consecutive numbers.

        "solution": "We apply the complement principle: we find the total number of cases in which the 2 green places are adjacent, and subtract from the total number of cases.\nThere are $\\frac{10!}{5!2!2!1!} = 7560$ ways to arrange the plates in a linear fashion. However, since the plates are arranged in a circle, there are $10$ ways to rotate the plates, and so there are $7560/10 = 756$ ways to arrange the plates in a circular fashion (consider, for example, fixing the orange plate at the top of the table).\nIf the two green plates are adjacent, we may think of them as a single entity, so that there are now $9$ objects to be placed around the table in a circular fashion. Using the same argument, there are $\\frac{9!}{5!2!1!1!} = 1512$ ways to arrange the objects in a linear fashion, and $1512/9 = 168$ ways in a circular fashion.\nThus, the answer is $756 - 168 = \\boxed{588}$."

        "problem": "Ten adults enter a room, remove their shoes, and toss their shoes into a pile. Later, a child randomly pairs each left shoe with a right shoe without regard to which shoes belong together. The probability that for every positive integer $k<5$, no collection of $k$ pairs made by the child contains the shoes from exactly $k$ of the adults is $\\frac{m}{n}$, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find $m+n.$\n",
        "solution": "Label the left shoes be $L_1,\\dots, L_{10}$ and the right shoes $R_1,\\dots, R_{10}$. Notice that there are $10!$ possible pairings.\nLet a pairing be \"bad\" if it violates the stated condition. We would like a better condition to determine if a given pairing is bad.\nNote that, in order to have a bad pairing, there must exist a collection of $k<5$ pairs that includes both the left and the right shoes of $k$ adults; in other words, it is bad if it is possible to pick $k$ pairs and properly redistribute all of its shoes to exactly $k$ people.\nThus, if a left shoe is a part of a bad collection, its corresponding right shoe must also be in the bad collection (and vice versa). To search for bad collections, we can start at an arbitrary right shoe (say $R_1$), check the left shoe it is paired with (say $L_i$), and from the previous observation, we know that $R_i$ must also be in the bad collection. Then we may check the left shoe paired with $R_i$, find its counterpart, check its left pair, find its counterpart, etc. until we have found $L_1$. We can imagine each right shoe \"sending\" us to another right shoe (via its paired left shoe) until we reach the starting right shoe, at which point we know that we have found a bad collection if we have done this less than $5$ times.\nEffectively we have just traversed a cycle. (Note: This is the cycle notation of permutations.) The only condition for a bad pairing is that there is a cycle with length less than $5$; thus, we need to count pairings where every cycle has length at least $5$. This is only possible if there is a single cycle of length $10$ or two cycles of length $5$.\nThe first case yields $9!$ working pairings. The second case yields $\\frac{{10\\choose 5}}{2}\\cdot{4!}^2=\\frac{10!}{2 \\cdot {5!}^2} \\cdot {4!}^2$ pairings. Therefore, taking these cases out of a total of $10!$, the probability is $\\frac{1}{10}+\\frac{1}{50} = \\frac{3}{25}$, for an answer of $\\boxed{28}$."

Similarily, there are ${9\\choose 2}$ ways to pick the vertical sides, giving us $r = 1296$ rectangles.\nFor $s$, there are $8^2$ unit squares, $7^2$ of the $2\\times2$ squares, and so on until $1^2$ of the $8\\times 8$ squares.
