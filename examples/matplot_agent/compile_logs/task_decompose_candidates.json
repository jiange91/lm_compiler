        "rationale": "Prompt 1 requires the agent to understand the user's query, which can be complex and ambiguous, and then decompose it into a series of detailed, executable steps. This involves identifying appropriate libraries, functions, and parameters, as well as data preparation and manipulation. The task is non-trivial and benefits from task decomposition for better interpretability and ease of reasoning."

        "rationale": "Prompt 3 requires the agent to debug existing code based on an error message and a user query. Debugging can be complex and non-trivial, as it involves understanding the code, identifying the source of the error, and fixing it. This task benefits from task decomposition and requires a good understanding of the code and error messages."

    "initial code generation": {
        "score": 3,
        "rationale": "Prompt 2 involves generating runnable Python code from a natural language query. While this requires vertical planning, reasoning, and decision-making, the sub-tasks (such as choosing libraries and writing code) are relatively straightforward for a capable LLM. The complexity is moderate but not overly challenging."

This requires vertical planning, reasoning, and decision-making, but the sub-tasks (such as modifying code and ensuring it runs correctly) are relatively straightforward for a capable LLM. The complexity is moderate but manageable."
