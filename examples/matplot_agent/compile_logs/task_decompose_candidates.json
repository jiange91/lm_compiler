    "query expansion": {
        "score": 4,
        "rationale": "The task requires understanding the user's query, breaking it down into detailed steps, identifying appropriate libraries and functions, and setting parameters correctly. This involves non-trivial reasoning and planning, as well as ensuring the code is executable and meets the user's requirements."

    "plot debugger": {
        "score": 4,
        "rationale": "The task involves debugging existing code based on an error message. This requires understanding the code, identifying the error, and fixing it, which can be non-trivial and benefit from task decomposition for better interpretability and ease of reasoning."

    "initial code generation": {
        "score": 3,
        "rationale": "The task involves generating runnable Python code based on a natural language query. While it requires vertical planning and decision-making, the sub-tasks (e.g., data manipulation, plotting) are relatively straightforward for a capable LLM."
    },
    "visual refine coder": {
        "score": 3,
        "rationale": "The task involves improving existing code based on natural language instructions while retaining its original functionality. This requires vertical planning and decision-making, but the sub-tasks are relatively straightforward for a capable LLM."
