    "query expansion": {
        "score": 4,
        "rationale": "Prompt 1 requires the agent to understand the user's query, which can be complex and varied, and then decompose it into a series of detailed, executable steps. This involves identifying appropriate libraries, functions, and parameters, as well as data preparation and manipulation. The task is non-trivial and benefits from task decomposition for better interpretability and ease of reasoning."
    },
    "initial code generation": {
        "score": 3,
        "rationale": "Prompt 2 involves generating runnable Python code from a natural language query. While this requires vertical planning, reasoning, and decision-making, the sub-tasks (such as choosing libraries and writing code) are relatively straightforward for a capable LLM. The complexity is moderate but manageable."

    "plot debugger": {
        "score": 3,
        "rationale": "Prompt 3 involves debugging existing Python code based on an error message. This requires understanding the code, identifying the source of the error, and fixing it. While this involves multi-step reasoning and decision-making, the sub-tasks are generally straightforward for a capable LLM."
    },
    "visual refine coder": {
        "score": 3,
        "rationale": "Prompt 4 involves improving existing code based on natural language instructions while retaining its original functionality. This requires understanding the existing code, interpreting the instructions, and making the necessary modifications. The task involves vertical planning and decision-making, but the sub-tasks are relatively simple."
