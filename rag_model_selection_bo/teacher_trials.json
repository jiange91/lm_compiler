            "answer": "Agent memory in the context of artificial intelligence or computational agents can be categorized into several types, each serving distinct functions:\n\n1. **Sensory Memory**: This type of memory involves learning embedding representations from raw inputs. It acts as the initial stage where sensory data is processed and converted into a form that can be used by the agent.\n\n2. **Short-Term Memory**: Short-term memory is used for in-context learning and is limited by the finite context window length of models like Transformers. It allows the agent to hold and manipulate information temporarily for immediate tasks.\n\n3. **Long-Term Memory**: Long-term memory serves as an external vector store that can be accessed via fast retrieval methods such as Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS). This type of memory helps overcome the limitations of the finite attention span of short-term memory by storing information that can be retrieved efficiently when needed.\n\n4. **Procedural Memory**: Procedural memory is a type of long-term memory that involves unconscious skills and routines, such as riding a bike or typing on a keyboard. Agents use procedural memory to perform tasks automatically, allowing for the execution of complex actions without conscious thought.\n\n5. **Episodic Memory**: Although not detailed in the provided Q+A pairs, episodic memory typically refers to the ability to recall specific events or experiences. In agents, this would involve storing and retrieving information about particular interactions or occurrences.\n\n6. **Semantic Memory**: Similarly, semantic memory, though not detailed in the provided Q+A pairs, generally refers to the storage of general knowledge and facts. For agents, this would involve maintaining a repository of information that can be used to understand and generate responses based on learned knowledge.\n\nThese different types of memory interact within an agent's architecture to enable efficient processing, storage, and retrieval of information, allowing the agent to perform a wide range of tasks effectively. Sensory memory processes raw inputs, short-term memory handles immediate tasks, and long-term memory stores information for future use, with procedural memory enabling automatic execution of learned skills."
