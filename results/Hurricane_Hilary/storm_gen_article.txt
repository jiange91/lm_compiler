# Background

Hurricane Hilary was a large and powerful Pacific hurricane that formed in August 2023, causing significant impacts across the Pacific Coast of Mexico, the Baja California Peninsula, and the Southwestern United States. It brought torrential rainfall and gusty winds, leading to widespread flooding and numerous mudslides, resulting in Hilary being classified as a Category 4 hurricane at its peak intensity[1][2].

## Formation and Development

The origins of Hurricane Hilary can be traced back to a tropical wave that departed the western coast of Africa around August 3, 2023. This wave progressed westward across the Atlantic Ocean and reached the Lesser Antilles by August 9, where the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first identified the potential for development[1]. By August 12, the wave had crossed into the far eastern Pacific Ocean, producing disorganized thunderstorms. As early as August 13, hurricane prediction models suggested that a tropical cyclone might impact Mexico and the southwestern United States, ultimately leading to the storm's formation[1][2].
Upon its formation, Hilary rapidly intensified due to favorable atmospheric and environmental conditions, including warm sea surface temperatures around 86°F (30°C), ample moisture, and low wind shear. The storm reached its peak intensity of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 940 mbar (28 inHg) on August 20, 2023, making it one of the most powerful storms of the season[1][2].

## Impact and Aftermath

Hurricane Hilary's approach to the Southwestern United States brought significant rainfall, with some desert areas experiencing over half of their annual rainfall in a single day. Wind gusts were recorded at up to 87 mph (140 km/h) in Los Angeles County and 84 mph (135 km/h) in San Diego County, contributing to extensive damage[1][2]. The storm resulted in catastrophic flooding and mudslides across various regions, with reports of destruction in places like Santa Rosalía and Comondú in Mexico, where homes were severely damaged[3][1][2].
In addition to its immediate impacts, Hurricane Hilary's record-breaking precipitation resulted in the establishment of new rainfall records in four U.S. states, highlighting the increasing intensity and frequency of such storms in the context of climate change[2][4].

# Impact

Hurricane Hilary had a significant impact across various regions, particularly in Mexico and Southern California, leading to widespread damage and disruptions.

## Mexico

In Mexico, the storm prompted the evacuation of thousands of residents to shelters as ports along the coast were closed. The National Hurricane Center issued its first-ever tropical storm warning for Southern California, reflecting the seriousness of the threat posed by Hilary[1]. In Baja California Sur, the storm caused extensive flooding and landslides, leading to damage to homes and infrastructure. Specifically, in Santa Rosalía, 26 houses were destroyed, while 15 buildings were wrecked in Comondú[1]. Additionally, the region's criminal justice system faced challenges due to the storm, including the evacuation of prisoners and loss of accountability for those under law enforcement supervision[5].
The storm also damaged utilities and roads, including potholes and the Transpeninsular Highway, and caused disruptions to 40 elementary schools, although classes were able to resume as scheduled[1]. Overall, the hurricane resulted in four fatalities in Mexico, all related to incidents involving vehicles[1].

## Southern California

As Hurricane Hilary approached Southern California, extensive preparations were made to mitigate its impacts. Numerous airlines canceled flights, leading to at least 1,000 cancellations and 3,700 delays at major airports across the region[1]. Fullerton College and various school districts closed in anticipation of severe weather, while services such as DoorDash temporarily suspended operations in affected areas[1][6].
The storm led to widespread flooding and rockslides, particularly impacting rural communities. Emergency shelters were opened across California, Arizona, and Nevada to accommodate those displaced by the storm's effects[6]. The state's Office of Emergency Services coordinated efforts to ensure resources were available for response and recovery[7].

# Preparations

In anticipation of Hurricane Hilary, various emergency management agencies and local officials have implemented extensive preparations to ensure the safety of residents and mitigate potential impacts. It is critical for those in the path of the storm to heed emergency alerts and take immediate action as recommended by local authorities[4][8].

## Government Coordination

At the direction of California Governor Gavin Newsom, the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) is actively coordinating state and local preparations. The agency maintains constant communication with the National Hurricane Center and local emergency management officials to facilitate a unified response. The State Operations Center in Mather, California, is already engaged in resource allocation to support affected regions before and after the storm's impact[7][8]. FEMA is also closely monitoring Hurricane Hilary while coordinating federal response efforts and stands ready to provide necessary support[8][9].

## Local Preparations

Cities across Southern California have begun implementing precautionary measures such as constructing sand berms along beaches and distributing sandbags at fire stations to protect against anticipated storm surges. For example, Long Beach officials have made sandbags available to residents as part of the storm preparedness efforts[10][6][11]. Residents are advised to move valuables to higher ground and ensure their properties are secured against flooding and debris[6][11].

## Community Involvement

Residents are encouraged to stay informed by signing up for local weather alerts and emergency notifications. The importance of receiving timely alerts cannot be overstated, as it allows individuals to act swiftly in response to changing conditions[4][6]. Community members can also engage with local government for resources and assistance, thereby enhancing overall preparedness within neighborhoods[11].

## Emergency Resources

Emergency shelters have been established in California and neighboring states such as Arizona and Nevada to accommodate those affected by flooding and power outages due to the storm. These shelters are crucial for providing refuge and support to evacuees[6]. Moreover, the public has been reminded that emergency response sites are protected areas, ensuring that immigration enforcement does not impede the delivery of vital services during the disaster[9].

# Aftermath

Following the passage of Hurricane Hilary, the storm left significant impacts across California, Arizona, and Nevada, prompting widespread emergency responses and relief efforts. The aftermath saw heavy rainfall that caused flooding, power outages, and numerous rockslides throughout Southern California, with Red Cross disaster teams opening emergency shelters in affected areas[6]. Local authorities issued evacuation orders in places such as Catalina Island and towns in San Bernardino County to ensure public safety[6][11].
The response to Hurricane Hilary highlighted the importance of community preparedness. Residents were advised to move valuables to upper stories of their homes and utilize sandbags provided by municipalities to mitigate flooding risks[11][4]. Governor Gavin Newsom's administration coordinated state-level efforts through the California Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES), which maintained communication with the National Hurricane Center and local emergency management officials to streamline response strategies[7].
