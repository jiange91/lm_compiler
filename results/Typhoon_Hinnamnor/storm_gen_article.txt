# Overview

Typhoon Hinnamnor was a significant tropical cyclone that formed in the Pacific Ocean during late August 2022. It gained attention for its potential impact on several regions, particularly Japan and Taiwan. The typhoon reached Category 5 status, indicating a severe intensity, which was notable as it kicked off the storm season after a period of unusual quiet in the Atlantic Ocean[1][2].
Hinnamnor's development was closely monitored due to the increasing concerns about the relationship between tropical storms and climate change. While warmer oceans do not necessarily lead to more storms, they can increase the frequency of major ones, as was the case with Hinnamnor, which benefited from the heat energy provided by elevated ocean temperatures[1][2].
The storm exhibited erratic behavior in its path, leading to uncertainty regarding its landfall. Initial predictions suggested it would affect Taiwan, but as it approached, it began to veer northward, diminishing the likelihood of a direct hit on the island[2]. Throughout its lifecycle, Hinnamnor was responsible for catastrophic flooding and wind damage in parts of Japan, showcasing the destructive potential of powerful typhoons in the region[2].

# Formation and Development

Typhoon Hinnamnor, the first super typhoon of the 2022 Pacific typhoon season, originated from a disturbed area of weather first noted on August 27, 2022, by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[3]. By August 28, this area intensified and was designated as Tropical Storm Hinnamnor. The storm rapidly intensified, achieving typhoon status on August 29, and continued to gain strength as it moved northward into the East China Sea[3][2].
Several meteorological factors contributed to the rapid development of Hinnamnor. It formed over warm tropical waters with temperatures several degrees above average, which helped sustain its intensity[2]. The absence of significant vertical wind shear and high ocean heat content also favored the storm's development, enabling it to strengthen quickly[4]. Hinnamnor exhibited a notable pattern of rapid intensification, reaching major storm status on September 4, shortly before its landfall near Busan, South Korea, on September 5 as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon[3][2].
The genesis and intensity of Hinnamnor were also influenced by broader atmospheric conditions, including the slow variation of sea surface temperatures and circulation features that occur on a near-10-year cycle[5]. The storm displayed unique behaviors, including rapid intensification, rapid weakening, and re-intensification, which posed challenges for forecasting[6]. The interaction with other local meteorological systems further contributed to its expansion and intensity during its lifecycle[4].

# Impact and Effects

## Overview

Typhoon Hinnamnor caused significant disruption across various regions, notably affecting the Philippines, South Korea, and the Russian Far East. The storm brought heavy rains, resulting in damage to infrastructure, displacement of individuals, and even loss of life.

## Effects in the Philippines

In the Philippines, Hinnamnor brought heavy rainfall to the northern province of Batanes, affecting 2,442 people as reported by the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) by September 7. Of those affected, 51 individuals were displaced and 192 were preemptively evacuated. The typhoon resulted in the damage or destruction of at least 12 homes, with infrastructure damage estimated at ₱61.4 million (approximately US$1.08 million)【1】. Tragically, a man died in Ifugao due to the heavy rains brought by Hinnamnor【1】.

## Effects in South Korea

Although the initial forecasts suggested severe impacts, the actual effects of Hinnamnor in South Korea were less extensive than anticipated, primarily due to the storm's rapid movement【1】. Nonetheless, the country faced disruptions, including the cancellation of at least 56 flights, which affected over 3,000 passengers. Early in the morning on September 5, JR West announced the planned suspension of the Sanyo Shinkansen on September 6, confirming suspensions between Hakata and Hiroshima later that evening【1】. Communication services were also interrupted, particularly in Kito-Daito【1】.

## Effects in the Russian Far East

In the Russian Far East, the extratropical remnants of Hinnamnor caused severe flooding in Primorsky Krai, where Governor Oleg Kozhemyako reported that eight individuals lost their lives due to the flooding. More than 2,300 homes were inundated, with 49 of those being destroyed. Approximately 15,000 people were affected, and the total damage in the region was estimated to be around ₽6 billion (approximately US$98.7 million)【1】.

# Meteorological Data

Typhoon Hinnamnor is recognized as the strongest global storm of 2022, with maximum sustained winds reaching 175 km/h (109 mph) as reported by the Hong Kong Observatory[7]. Formed in the Western Pacific, Hinnamnor emerged at the end of an unusually quiet August for storms in the Atlantic[1]. Its intensity is attributed to significantly above-average sea surface temperatures, which provide additional energy that can sustain and strengthen tropical storms[2].
The typhoon is projected to gradually move northward into the East China Sea, with forecasts indicating that it may impact parts of Southwestern Japan, Eastern China, and South Korea over the coming days[4]. As the storm approaches, evacuations and flight cancellations have been implemented in Japan's Okinawa[7]. Meteorological models suggest that rainfall from Hinnamnor could lead to substantial flooding, with localized amounts potentially exceeding 150 millimeters in various regions, including up to 120 millimeters in Tohoku and 100 millimeters in Tokai[8][4].
Experts note that if Hinnamnor stalls over specific areas, it could exacerbate rainfall totals, resulting in significant flood risks[9]. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has classified the typhoon as 'violent' and expects it to slow down and stall temporarily while continuing to intensify[4]. The potential for severe weather impacts is influenced by the storm's proximity to small islands, with the eye of the storm's location being critical for assessing wind damage and storm surge possibilities[9].

# Response and Recovery

## Overview of Response Efforts

The response to Typhoon Hinnamnor involved coordinated efforts from government agencies and non-governmental organizations to mitigate its impact on affected communities. Prior to the storm's arrival, authorities emphasized the importance of evacuation, resulting in over 14,000 people leaving their homes in high-risk areas under government orders.[10] The government also issued 412 typhoon-related mobile safety alerts, including evacuation orders, across various regions in the days leading up to and following the storm.[10]

## Emergency Relief Measures

After Typhoon Hinnamnor made landfall, significant emergency relief measures were implemented to assist the affected populations. Approximately 4,500 additional individuals were evacuated following the storm, showcasing the ongoing efforts to ensure the safety of residents.[10] In the immediate aftermath, local and national agencies worked to assess damage and provide essential services, including shelter, food, and medical assistance to those impacted by the typhoon.

# Comparisons

## Typhoon Hinnamnor and Typhoon Haiyan

Typhoon Hinnamnor, much like Typhoon Haiyan, exemplifies the potential intensity and destructiveness of tropical cyclones in the northwest Pacific region. Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest storms ever recorded, had sustained winds exceeding 150 mph and caused extensive devastation in the Philippines in 2013. Its aftermath highlighted critical needs for disaster preparedness and community resilience, with extensive international aid efforts that reached over 1.6 million people in the years following the storm.[11]
In contrast, Typhoon Hinnamnor displayed unique characteristics throughout its lifecycle, including rapid intensification and sudden changes in track, which presented distinct forecasting challenges. Hinnamnor exhibited phases of rapid intensification (RI), rapid weakening (RW), and re-intensification (Re-I), which are particularly significant in tropical cyclone research and forecasting[6].

## Meteorological Context

Both typhoons underscore the impact of regional climatic conditions on cyclone development. While Hinnamnor's intensity was bolstered by warm tropical waters and the absorption of local meteorological systems[4], Typhoon Haiyan also thrived in similar warm conditions that contribute to tropical cyclone formation in the region. The northwest Pacific, often referred to as typhoon alley, is known for generating the planet's most powerful tropical cyclones due to its unique climatic features and oceanic conditions[5].
Moreover, the genesis and intensity of both storms can be influenced by the slow variations of sea surface temperatures and circulation features, which operate on nearly a decade-long frequency. These factors are crucial in understanding the dynamics of tropical cyclone formation and their subsequent intensity increases[5].

## Human Impact and Preparedness

The human impact of these typhoons showcases the vulnerabilities of affected regions. Typhoon Haiyan's legacy served as a poignant reminder of the necessity for effective disaster preparedness and response strategies[11]. In the case of Hinnamnor, the lessons learned from previous storms may inform better predictive measures and community readiness, highlighting the importance of understanding each storm's unique behavior and regional effects.
