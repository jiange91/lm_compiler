# Overview

Typhoon Hinnamnor was a significant tropical cyclone that formed in the Pacific Ocean during late August 2022. It gained attention for its potential impact on several regions, particularly Japan and Taiwan. The typhoon reached Category 5 status, indicating a severe intensity, which was notable as it kicked off the storm season after a period of unusual quiet in the Atlantic Ocean[1][2].
Hinnamnor's development was closely monitored due to the increasing concerns about the relationship between tropical storms and climate change. While warmer oceans do not necessarily lead to more storms, they can increase the frequency of major ones, as was the case with Hinnamnor, which benefited from the heat energy provided by elevated ocean temperatures[1][2].
The storm exhibited erratic behavior in its path, leading to uncertainty regarding its landfall. Initial predictions suggested it would affect Taiwan, but as it approached, it began to veer northward, diminishing the likelihood of a direct hit on the island[2]. Throughout its lifecycle, Hinnamnor was responsible for catastrophic flooding and wind damage in parts of Japan, showcasing the destructive potential of powerful typhoons in the region[2].

# Formation and Development

Typhoon Hinnamnor, the first super typhoon of the 2022 Pacific typhoon season, originated from a disturbed area of weather first noted on August 27, 2022, by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC)[4]. By August 28, this area intensified and was designated as Tropical Storm Hinnamnor. The storm rapidly intensified, achieving typhoon status on August 29, and continued to gain strength as it moved northward into the East China Sea[4][2].
Several meteorological factors contributed to the rapid development of Hinnamnor. It formed over warm tropical waters with temperatures several degrees above average, which helped sustain its intensity[2]. The absence of significant vertical wind shear and high ocean heat content also favored the storm's development, enabling it to strengthen quickly[6]. Hinnamnor exhibited a notable pattern of rapid intensification, reaching major storm status on September 4, shortly before its landfall near Busan, South Korea, on September 5 as a Category 2-equivalent typhoon[4][2].
The genesis and intensity of Hinnamnor were also influenced by broader atmospheric conditions, including the slow variation of sea surface temperatures and circulation features that occur on a near-10-year cycle[8]. The storm displayed unique behaviors, including rapid intensification, rapid weakening, and re-intensification, which posed challenges for forecasting[5]. The interaction with other local meteorological systems further contributed to its expansion and intensity during its lifecycle[6].

Approximately 15,000 people were affected, and the total damage in the region was estimated to be around ₽6 billion (approximately US$98.7 million)【1】.

# Meteorological Data

Typhoon Hinnamnor is recognized as the strongest global storm of 2022, with maximum sustained winds reaching 175 km/h (109 mph) as reported by the Hong Kong Observatory[9]. Formed in the Western Pacific, Hinnamnor emerged at the end of an unusually quiet August for storms in the Atlantic[1]. Its intensity is attributed to significantly above-average sea surface temperatures, which provide additional energy that can sustain and strengthen tropical storms[2].
The typhoon is projected to gradually move northward into the East China Sea, with forecasts indicating that it may impact parts of Southwestern Japan, Eastern China, and South Korea over the coming days[6]. As the storm approaches, evacuations and flight cancellations have been implemented in Japan's Okinawa[9]. Meteorological models suggest that rainfall from Hinnamnor could lead to substantial flooding, with localized amounts potentially exceeding 150 millimeters in various regions, including up to 120 millimeters in Tohoku and 100 millimeters in Tokai[10][6].
Experts note that if Hinnamnor stalls over specific areas, it could exacerbate rainfall totals, resulting in significant flood risks[11]. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has classified the typhoon as 'violent' and expects it to slow down and stall temporarily while continuing to intensify[6]. The potential for severe weather impacts is influenced by the storm's proximity to small islands, with the eye of the storm's location being critical for assessing wind damage and storm surge possibilities[11].

## Meteorological Context

Both typhoons underscore the impact of regional climatic conditions on cyclone development. While Hinnamnor's intensity was bolstered by warm tropical waters and the absorption of local meteorological systems[6], Typhoon Haiyan also thrived in similar warm conditions that contribute to tropical cyclone formation in the region. The northwest Pacific, often referred to as typhoon alley, is known for generating the planet's most powerful tropical cyclones due to its unique climatic features and oceanic conditions[8].
Moreover, the genesis and intensity of both storms can be influenced by the slow variations of sea surface temperatures and circulation features, which operate on nearly a decade-long frequency. These factors are crucial in understanding the dynamics of tropical cyclone formation and their subsequent intensity increases[8].

## Human Impact and Preparedness

The human impact of these typhoons showcases the vulnerabilities of affected regions. Typhoon Haiyan's legacy served as a poignant reminder of the necessity for effective disaster preparedness and response strategies[7]. In the case of Hinnamnor, the lessons learned from previous storms may inform better predictive measures and community readiness, highlighting the importance of understanding each storm's unique behavior and regional effects.
